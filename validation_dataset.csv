I look forward to every issue of this magazine. It has great information and beautiful illustrations. Getting copies in both paper form and on line is especially useful to me.,5
Similar to the New statesman but just on the other side of the political fence. Very enjoyable read,4
"This is jam packed full of very useful stuff - I read it from cover to cover and saved it for further reading when needed.
Well worth every cent!

My husband loves! One of the few magazines he requests year after year.,5
Great magazine and great value,5
Makes me feel like less of a man to read this stupid magazine.  Advertisements and fluff articles.  Like Martha Stewart Living and the New Yorker for suburban men.  No thanks.,1
Have not received the first issue of this magazine. Not sure if I will ever get it. When will I get the magazine or my refund?,1
This magazine has some very pretty pictures; that's all. I guess it works fine for people with money but It doesn't do anything for me.,3
I like the paper version better and the yearly price is ridiculous!,1
Some recipes but way to many pages devoted to advertising! Wouldn't buy it again.,3
I bought this for a Father's Day gift for my dad and he is enjoying it.  :),4
Please  cancel present subscription as it no longer is being read by my granddaughter . She is now too old for this magazine .  Thank you.,1
Always was late and I ended up moving and decided it wasn't worth re-routing.,2
Got this for my grandson - he loves it.,5

Can't live without my Vogue,5

"Wonderful ... if you're a liberal. Unfortunately, I'm not.",3
My favorite magazine.  Can't wait to receive it in the mail each month!,5
Not much in the magazine anymore,3
"Too many ads, not enough practical information",2
The quality of the mag isn't as nice as shown in the photo,3
This is a fun magazine to read.  I have a subscription.  They really stay on top of the current trends and have some really good discounts for readers as well.,4
"They were great, but need a smaller size.",3
"Ads everywhere and hardly any articles. Nothing to read, really. More like an ad catalog than a magazine. I'm cancelling the auto renewal.",1

"I usually thumb through Bicycling mag., but i read the MTB supplimental from front to back.",4
"Great magazine, good tips and tricks that you can apply to every day riding.",4
My brother loves this! And I was surprised at how fast they came and how much did come! The price was a steal! I'm very happy with this product!,5

Love the magazine - but I often to not receive the current issue. Seems like it skips an issue about every two weeks.,3

"Nice, short easy to read articles. Not for the professional. For the Psych curious.",3
Can't live without my tv guide. Love the stories and love how easy it is to read the nights setup.,5
I feel like Women's Health isn't a true health magazine anymore. It's more like a trashy Cosmo with more focus on losing weight...doesn't exactly inspire me to get to the gym.,3
very thin not like years ago,2
Love this magazine. It is perfect for the 50+ woman who still wants to be fashion forward and age appropriate,5
A good mix of basics and more advanced ideas.  I like it.,4

I have always loved this maggie and I still do,5
I also have not received my TV Guide.  Bought it for my husband as one of his Christmas gifts.  Oh well.....lesson learned.,1

Magazine arrives sporadically and we have been asked to subscribe again every month since the first issue.  I am not happy at all,1
Few out there. Euro mags are much better. US better step up.,2
first impressions are very good..,4
like every other home mag. but nice pics,4
"Time-sensitive data such as mint release dates and pricing is not current in a monthly magazine such as this, but the articles are very interesting and I enjoy it very much.",4
I am still waiting for my first issue to arrive so at this time I can't review.  Was told it could take up to 12 weeks to start...apparently that's true.,1
She's very positive I look forward to her magazine every month.,5
This is my drool magazine.  I wish I could afford the clothes so I have to put together looks that I like for less.  One of these days.....,1

"Enjoy reading the magazine, but have trouble bringing up  on line.",4
Could not download.,1
Not my kind of travel. Too spendy.,2

"What's not to like?  It is National Geographic.  Beautiful photography & interesting articles from around the world.  Great deal, subscribe.",5
Contained more articles than most magazines. Catered to women...had interesting topics. Layout was done nicely.,4
This magazine has become nonsense.,1
Terribly short on quantity. It's seemed like a very small leaflet. Not worth the $5.,1

magazine even though they respond that its on the way!!",1
NOT TARGETED FOR TEENAGERS,1

I love these magazines. They are really helpful and help you think of things that you normally wouldn't. They have many great ideas with cut sizes for wood projects.,5

Very happy,5
We have not received the magazine so it is ibpossible to review. Please let us know when we can expect to receive it.,1
Among the best off road enthusiasts magazines.  I would give it 5 Stars but like all magazines these days there seem to be more advertisements than articles.,4
"I will not renew it. I subscribe to many other food/cooking magazines, so I definitely have others to compare it to. It does not have the kind of recipes I would make.",3

If your thinking of subscribing swing by a news stand and check it out first. I won't be re-subscribing.,1

Nice ideas,4

Terrific magazine.  The fashion is fun and inspiring and the articles are excellent.  Happy to continue to receive Vogue for another year.,5
Please stop my subscription.,1
Thought this was a monthly magazine. Buyer receivies one mag every 3 months. Every three months one can almost forget they ordered the magazine.,1
"I paid, I did not receive. I forgot about it. Too many ads anyways. I never received a single issue of the one year subscription",1
He enjoys this...  it is like the old holiday 'Sears 'catalog.  loots to dream about .  Not alot of practical info though,4

"Love the magazine but hate the new format for the kindle. And why can't I see my library of issues?  I wasn't caught up, and now they're gone!",1
How in world can you charge more for the print version vs. the Kindle version? $24 for Kindle vs. $15 for print...doesnt make any sense to me.,1

Way too many ads; and articles that are broken up for a print edition --which is so silly and unnecessary anyway-- are annoying to navigate to in a digital edition.,2
So so magazine.  Perfect for a waiting room.,3
"I was sent the guide for the East Coast, not West Coast. No 24 hour listings. Format is too incomplete.",3
It's garbage. Full of adverts/commercials. Just a few health talk or discussion. This is not the Health magazine or journal of those days.,1
I look forward to receiving this magazine each month so I can throw it directly into the garbage. 99% adds with 1% fluff content. Awful waste of paper.,1
"If you into gaming, into the latest PC tech info, like reviews of hardware rated 1 thru 10, chomp PC builds, get this rag. @ $12 bucks for 2 years its worth every penny",1

My favorite magazine.  It is practical and fun.,5
good online mag,4

this magazine will mostly give you complex advertizing disguised as reviews and reports. very little practical use.,1
My kids LOVE this magazine and read it cover to cover every time it arrives.,5
It's definitely not the magazine I read when I was living in Texas,1
"Ordered as a gift.  The order process was confulsing, and never reached the recipient.  I'm sure the magazine itself is great.",3
Love the Geographic. This is the best price out there!,5
I haven't received all the issues in the mail and I can't access the website on my kindle.  DO NOT buy this.,1
"Haven""t received yet. Had to buy in store! Waiting for it to come to my home, then I can comment.",1
"can't be better,a a a a a a a a a  a a a mazon! i love you amazonnnnnnn n n n",5
"for some reason i was subscribed to it, i tried to unsubscribe and it didn't work at all. but oh well",2
Unable to access subscription in any way using anything. Either Kindle or Car and Driver need a lot of work.....,1
"not alot of substance to the few articles,",2
Has some relivant topics. I'm always interested in hearing about IRA's and 401k's. Good reading for the novice.,4
Decent articles but the adds have gotten out of hand.,3
cancelled. too much advertisement.,1
My son looks forward to this every month!,5
"I ordered the electronic AND the print version,i have not been receiving the print issues.
and the magazine quality is HORRIBLE,  it's used to be fantastic",1
I was very disappointed that our subscription to Runner's Times was moved over to Running World. I haven't seen my husband pick this up to read since the change.,1
"Started getting my magazines already! Loving them. Fab price as well. Lots of neat things, ideas and such inside. Def worth keeping.",5
Not a very good emag,3
promotes ignorance through fear-mongering,1
"Love it.
Great magazine.",5
"If you enjoy wines from the northwest, this is the best resource available for news, tasting notes, and reviews.",5
"Now that Smart Money doesn't print, this is the best non-technical finance magazine around-- much better than Money!!",5
Magazine is great. Have not received the tote.,3
"FULL of ads, hardly any content at all. Not worth paying for it.",1
"Like to see nice pictures of attractions. Yes, there are ads but all relevant.",4
I look forward to this magazine every week to keep me up to date on all the entertainment. Great magazine!,5
Love seeing all these ideas about crocheting. Love the format and the designs. Also the directions seem easy to understand.,4
Good articles. Sometimes lose their NYC focus,4
I cannot provide a good review for this purchase because as of today I have not received it yet.  Still waiting..........,1
"Warning. Downloading from this site, and reading the material will cause your Kindle to become inoperable, or, at least in my case--more than once.",1
"The amount of interesting articles declined. I'd like to see articles on car technology, automation, control, drones, robots, kids teaching technology tools, etc",3
Love this mag.  read it cover to cover every month!,5
"Good reading for fashion & makeup tips, a little lacking in articles.",4
Not the magazine it use to be. Last few issues have had nothing but filler information and ads in them,1
"It has a few articles that are worth reading, but mostly I found my self simply skimming the articles.",3
Time lost our confidence with this incredibly biased article. I no longer trust this magazine to offer objective news stories.,1
Somewhat good. Is nothing important on this magazine at all.,3
Full of garbage advertisement to do franchise. There quality keeps going down like CNN. Now it is straight garbage.,1
Why is it soooooo big??  Good articles though.,4
"Renewed for another year as she loves her magazine, looking forward to every issue!",5
not a fan but my husband is,3
I'm reading it on my kindle and it's difficult to get to different sections. That's my only complaint on the magazine,3
The best Journal for understanding International Relations,5
Amazing magazine I will subscribe again for sure,5
I got carpel tunnel syndrome just trting to get through the ads. Not happy.,1
My girl loves to take the quizzes and read the articles about what girls her age have done to make the world a better place. Great!,5
NG has become politically liberal junk.,1
"I'd be happy to write a detailed review of this product, if I had a product to review. I've still NEVER received an issue. I guess I will be contacting customer service.",1
It has not been in my Kindle yet....I ordered it but has not been listed in my Kindle 2?? Why not?,1
Been reading this magazine for 55 years.  It is wonderful.,5
unsubscribed,1
Terrible adaptation to Kindle. Weak articles. Not as it used to be.,1
Nothing really exciting,1
wonderful mag..,5
Perfect gift for my boyfriend glad I spotted it and bought it before the issue came out he loves it,5
Look forward to the 1st of each month to get Nvate. Love that it is written by the young crowd. Like its openess to ideas and its scope.,5
I have been subscribing to Entertainment Weekly for years. It is the most informative and down to earth publication on the market.,5
This is one of the best cooking resources that I have found.  If you love to cook and not just follow a recipe then you must try this magazine.,5
Love this magazine! Great tips and lots of gear showcased and great tips and exercises to practice.,5
Classic ...can't go wrong with National Geographic.,5
Used to read this magazine. It has really gone down the tubes. Especially when you pick an athlete as a great patroit. Will never read it again. Fashion sense sucks now.,1
It's just okay. Don't expect much when you order it through Amazon for cheap - pretty sure it's about half of their regular issue size.,3
Too much to read in mmy time frame,3
"I love the magazine, but it doesn't deliver on time!",3
"House Beautiful inspires me to make little changes in my home to keep 'in style.'  There's always an article about using color, and Alex has some good recipes!",4
I have enjoyed Reader's Digest for years.  I just recently tried it on my Kindle. I was unhappy with the typos in the Kindle version.,4
What a joke,1
"The main reason I wanted TV Guide was to get advance notice as to when TV shows would be coming on.  TV Guide is not very accurate on this especially on their ""double"" issues.",3
Very left wing biased publication. Not that that's a bad thing but I prefer middle of the road and didn't know this was such a politically biased magazine.,2
I bought this for my sister and it came with auto-renewal.  Now I can't work out how to cancel the subscript.,1
I cancelled my subscription to this magazine because it was not all that interesting and the content seemed a little stale.,2
Still a good mag. Petzal is great. But it seems like it's mostly an advertisement for overpriced gear.,3
You like guns? get this! so many great articles and new weapons coming out all the time.,5
This magazine doesn't really have much to it. I'm glad I got the subscription for free!,3
A terrible publication. This publication is of no assistance. Just go to the judgments on the courts website. Disorganised just a collection of randomly selected judgements.,1
A few good articles on finding a job. Almost nothing really all that helpful in the money Dept. Seemed like a lot of whining about things that aren't silver plattered.,3
Best cooking magazine,5
"thought i would give this magazine a second try and it was just as disappointing the second time around. the recipes suck and the ""chefs"" are so fake. don't waste your money.",1
This magazine is a must have for any coin collector.  The monthly price guide is great. The articles are informative and fun to read.,5
Just the same old fluff.  More advertisements than anything.,2
The articles have gotten very gimmicky with misleading headlines and pandering subject matters. It's a real shame wired sold out.,2
I purchased this for my son and he loves it!,5
Not exactly what expected. Too many ads not enough articles.,2
"this is fifty pages of advertising. really, why would you pay for that. not for me. it's really really not.",1
There are toooooo many advertisements in this magazine.  It's not enjoyable to read.  I expected much more WW recipes and tips.  I won't purchase it again.,2
"I cannot get the digital version to download and I wound up being charged for it twice, I use to get it free with my subscription to the paper mag, what gives???",1
enjoy this magazine so much,5
OMG the ads take up half of the magazine.  I could fall asleep before they get to the good articles.,3
My eight year old granddaughter received her first issue and loved it!  Makes her feel like a big girl.,5
My only complaint about this magazine is that it keeps getting smaller and smaller as do all print magazines.,4
Amazon offered a great Christmas special and I purchased this as a gift.  Love the magazine!  Very satisfied.,5
wont re-order,1
Its mainly all ads... no real substance. I like articles. If I wanted a picture book I would look on my baby's bookshelf,2
"The issue has more information and ideas than you can absorb in a month, which is why I've gone with the hard copy rather than digital.",3
I thought I would give Cosmo a try but it just isn't doing it for me.,3
My adopted grandchild loves to read and loves animals so she looks forward to every issue.,5
I have always Loved Vogue!! Great price!!,5
"Needs more out of the ordinary boats,more classic sailboats,and more tips and tricks (like weathering).",3
LOVE this magazine! I've tried all kinds of the recipes and love the ingredients listed within them.,5
Good gun mag to keep up with the latest,4
Great magazine but with no Kindle app (not Kindle) support not able to read on an Android tablet or smartphone.,3
"We have not received this magazine yet, as of today (2/11/10) it has been 10 weeks.",1
"1 star, because we are sick of you, Kendall.",1
"Not as good as Car and Driver and Motor Trend, but good enough to read if you are free and have nothing to do.",3
This magazine should change the ages to at least over the age of 13!!  Young girls get thrown info on obsessing over boys at way too young an age!!,1
"My favorite magazine, even better having it on my kindle.",5
each issue has huge ad promotion for lawyers or doctors also gives dates of events that have passed useless information classifieds are always the same pretty boring!,1
Only recieved 1 issue :-(,1
"where are all of my magazine subscription first issues???????

mark",1
"I thought it was pretty good, enjoyed reading it.",4
"We are going on six weeks and grandson still has not received a copy of this subscription. Can't give a review at this date, but thought we would be receiving his magazine soon.",1
worse I have seen in 40 years of getting the Playboy magazine.,1
"Wonderful choice for me. This had alot of ideas & the instructions along with them. Very easy to follow. Looking for new ideas? Pick this magazine, you'll be glad you did!",5
"They send to much extra trash with the magazine, the first month came with a renewal notice that my 12 month subscription was about to expire.",1
A great journalistic periodical....timely Jewell.,5
"Informative articles with up to date information on the changing attitudes, laws and grow techniques for the up and coming marijuana markets.",4
"The magazine is great for those things you need but cant find where to get them. winches, lights stuff like that",4
Have already ordered this in another order.  Don't need any more.  Thanks.,1
I would like to stop getting it.  not good .  Do you have any more quilting magazine?  Sorry I Love Quilting,1
Great publication. Lots of great resources and stories. Real Motivation for ANY entrepreneur! I especially love the 10 tips to build wealth that can be found in every issue.,5
I have not received a single issue however I did get a card from PS saying that the delivery would begin later (more than 6 weeks) than advertised because of demand.,1
"Do not like the digital format and too many advertisements. I was a big fan of the printed magazine, wish it had better formating.",2
Something for the kids to read over the summer. Hopefully it will entice them to read more.,3
I'm just not a fan of wired magazine.,1
not complete enough,2
Has many interesting articles.  I have it magazine on our coffee table at work.  Everyone love's them.,4
perhaps my expectations were too high.  Disappointed.,2
"If you are someone who actually cooks, you'll enjoy this.",4
"My 2nd favorite magazine, only to be preceded by Discover - which is a must have also. A good mix of all sciences.",5
"It's a magazine... is there really reviews on those??

 Yea is an pretty nice magazine.  Has all kinds of magazine stuff in it...",3
AWESOME INFORMATION,5
Awesome magazine. I have been reading this one for a long time because it provides a variety of information that is useful.,5
"I have no clue why I purchased this magazine. I was very disappointed in the content.  It's more like the Cosmopolitan magazine, which I also do not like.",2
good magazine it just never shows up on time,4
"One of the best out there, lots of material.",5
"For a magazine that is supposed to be cutting edge, it has one of the worst Kindle experiences out there.  I may as well be reading a PDF.",1
"its a good magazine, I just don't have all of the items and spices called for the recipes.. lol",3
"Cannot download in Kindle app on phone, Need to cancel or contact kindle team.",1
Thought it would help me in my finances but all topics were unrelated to me,1
"Cheesy articles, good coupons.",4
"This magazine isn't as good as I remember it. Actually, it sucks, and I wish I didn't have it coming to my house anymore.",3
I want to cancels cant efford it thsnkyou,1
The magazine is great. Don't use auto-renewal. You pay full retail cover price. Wait for a deal and you can get three subscriptions for the same prive.,2
One of my favorite fashion magazine,5
I liked the old Allure style much better.  These models not so attractive to look at.  Allure's articles on beauty products always very good.,4
"One of the best magazines I subscribe to. You learn about towns, restaurants and local events. You will live the photos!",5
Had picked this magazine before and liked it.  Each year I try a new magazine and this was the one this year.  It has lots of info and good articles.  Would appeal to all ages.,4
Love House Beautiful!!! A great Interior Design Mag!!!!!,5
My son absolutely loves this magazine. It really has expanded is playing and his interest in different artists.,5
This magazine did not download. I wouldn't give it even 1 star but I  couldn't submit a review unless I did.,1
I love this magazine; it relates to everyday life with great research backup!,5
Great magazine!  Everyone I know loves it.  I've bought subscriptions as gifts for people who raved when they read mine. And it is priced so reasonably!,5
"Bag and physical copy came separately, in that order, within 3 weeks of order!

Love this magazine! Makes me a little more motivated to workout!",5
"I love this magazine and having it on line is so helpful, without waiting for the mail and having it anywhere. It's great.",5
BEST MAGAZINE!,5
"I love Vegetarian Times - great recipes, relevant stories/articles, good stuff.  Its one of those subscriptions that I will have forever - its great!",5
This magazine is okay.  Its more ads than anything else but it does have a few good articles. I wouldn't renew.,3
SINGED UP FOR 1 YEAR AND THEY  RENEWED AND CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD FOR 2ND YEAR WITHOUT MY  OK. I LOOKED AT WHAT I SIGNED FOR AND DID NOT SEE AUTOMATIC RENEWALS.,1
Still have not received anything. Should have zero stars but I see I am forced to rate at 1 star.,1
Subscribed for my great grandson and he loves it.  llustrations are wonderful.,5
"Good solid magmazine.  AS usual, I wish there were less ads",4
"Cannot beat this deal, thanks!",5
"Yawn,  Only more anti President Trump fake news from the lefties in the SCUM Media Network.",1
Never ordered nor did I ever get credit for monthly and a. Hal book.  I have been trying to rea ch anaZon with no sucrsss,1
My wife is the vegetarian in the family but I like the times so I can find things to cook for her,4
It's really too bad I can't get it on my PC because I would sure like to read it. Who knows maybe if I could download the magazine and read it I might purchase a subscription.,1
"read the day arrival, the online version is nice addition.",4
Great magazine! Wonderful articles and recipes.,5
The articles were not well written nor were they particularly topical. Would not recommend for the thoughtful reader od ant political persuasion,1
"Like content , but way to much advertisements.",3
"I never received this order. I received an email stating they were cancelling it and I will receive a refund for the gift certificate, but never received it",1
Its not like the old popular mechanics. It has articles in it that to me don't belong. I won't be resubscribing.,2
I love the creative and thought provoking design ideas. I appreciate the articles that consider cost saving construction methods and also the interior decorating ideas.,4
Really the best way to experience this incomparable publication,5
"Cancel this subscription.
Thank you,
Gary Gronneberg",1
This magazine is weak.  Would never subscribe again.  All the articles are really vague and do not provide any actionable items.,1
"Too much advertising, not what I expected",2
I have always enjoyed the articles and the recipes.  You can never have too many recipes especially if it is healthier,4
this used to be my favorite shelter magazine but since the new editor has lost it's luster - too bad...,3
No stars because I can't access my digital copy as indicated on-line.  Not impressed.  Rip off!!!,1
I love reading magazines like STAR and US Weekly and magazines like that. I got a subscription on here and I only got like 2 issues of STAR,5
"Way too many, mostly non-relevant ads. Not much substance to the articles.",2
It's the best magazine out!!,5
"Great articles, just wish the mag was a bit thicker....",4
My 11 year old daughter loved this magazine.  I've just renewed her subscription.  Its a great purchase.,5
"Love people mag, my absolute favorite!",5
I have tried and tried to get Julys issue on my kindle with no avail,1
Lots of interesting content.  Always timely.,5
Reasonably informative but could/should be a lot better. Style and content not up to date; related website totally useless even for magazine subscribers.,1
I only gave Coastal Living Magazine 4 stars because there are a few too many ads throughout the magazine but I will subscribe for at least one year.,3
To have the option of viewing Inc. in both versions is an economical convenience for me.,4
"Great new formate, full of great information. Really love this magazine. Look forward to the next edition",5
I cannot remember when I wasn't a subscriber in one way or another.  the magazine remains fantastic and informative.,5
I was excited to get my first issue.  but was soon dissappointed.  Here it is june and my issue is for may.  Not happy.,1
"good magazine, Amazon had a great deal for a subscription",4
The best magazine available!!,5
Tooo many ads now.,2
I like the fashion section a lot,4
"I ordered this for my 7 year old, and he loves this magazine. He gets so excited every time a new issue arrives. Great for anyone who loves cats.",5
Not happy with this magazine.  Trying to switch it with something else.  Don't want this anymore!,1
For $29.99 USD you get a year sub and a free book if you sign up through Juxtapoz. Anyone that falls for this trap deserves to pay 10 more bucks.,1
MISSING ISSUES,1
"Magazine is great, but has too many advertisements and not enough stories.",3
Tried it out with a deal of the day. Very thin 'magazine' not a lot of anything remarkable. Articles are short.,2
I've been an avid fan of this magazine since I was 10 years old. Love it!,5
"It's the basic southern recipes for the holidays-nothing spectacular.  Actually, it's not very memorable.  I had forgotten I had it on my Kindle.",3
Bought for man with poor sight. Wanted the print able to be enlarged.  Does not work. Want to drop the magazine,1
Small and more advertizing than articles. Don't waste your money.,1
"Best bike magazine ever, love it. Great articles on riding safety too. Ron L",5
got this subscription for my godfather and he loves it. great father's day gift that reminds them all year long that you love them. :),5
I just didn't enjoy this very much. There wasn't really anything new about it. I prefer other magazines of this genre.,3
"I was not impressed with the magazine.
They are trying to cover too much in each issue.
I would like to see more depth in the issues

Please discontinue my trial subscription",2
"It's an acceptable magazine. There are some good recipes, but a lot of ads. I really prefer All Recipes,it has a better format.",3
EXCELLENT READ highly recommended,5
Great magazine! Great ideas in every issue!,5
While the magazine is good I had ordered it the previous year for a gift to my son.  They auto renewed it the following year and I could not cancel it.,1
"My first issue ever, and I think the photos are lovely, and and it is both informative and entertaining.  I think I am going to really enjoy the future issues",4
I can't read or open up the September 28th edition which shows in my newsstand as available.,1
Not worth 46 cents an issue.  It's a political rag.  There are just too many shiny pages that I can't use to wipe my butt with.,1
Recieved first issue.  Page fell out.  Many pages aren't printed probably and offset.  Need a new printer or they are passing off inferior copies.,1
Yes I love this magazine can't wait to get the rest of them,5
"Good price. It's like Vogue, lots of advertisements.",4
"good articles , good information. just not sure it would be worth reading every month",4
Pretty photography.  But this type of magazine is just not my cup of tea.  I'm sure others will love it.,3
"Best crossword puzzle anywhere.  Adam Platt, Restaurant reviewer always makes me hungry.  Nice in-depth journalism and lots of fun, frivolous stuff too",5
"waste of my money and worse, waste of my time.....",1
love this magazine and i could not resist the $5 price,5
been reading it for some 35-40 yrs,4
Always articles with substance that are easy to read.,4
"Horible, their app did not work on my older iPad and there was no way to read online on my laptop or desktop. How can a technology magazine be so technically incapable.",1
I love this magazine and the price is surely right.,5
Too nit plcky,2
My 7 year old loves this magazine,5
I HAVENT RECEIVED THE MAGAZINE AT ALL.... COULD YOU PLEASE MAKE SURE I GET IT... OR I WANT MY MONEY BACK..............,1
Just not my thing.  I cancelled the subscription.,1
Don't find it helpful or very interesting. Need to cancel future orders.,1
"I think they liked it second best to Guitar World.  None the less, it came on time and they were glad to try a new magazine.",4
Access .  Please cancel.,1
"This is the best magazine to keep up with the new technology, new products and just about anything that is new or upcoming tech in every area of life.",5
More ads then actual health or fitness content but what was in there was good. I'll continue to subscribe if on sale but wouldn't pay full price unless the ads were cut in half.,3
It's been more than a month and i haven't even got October's issue but you sure billed me for it though.,3
"You get much more value out of an online subscription, I absolutely love the content, but currently the Kindle version is WAY overpriced for what you get.",3
It a great magazine. I saw and learned things that I didn't know that was going on in the world it was worth the money,4
Love reading this!,5
I really enjoy the magazine and love the free gym bag!,5
"My vision of great vacations is anywhere on the water or near the shore, so this magazine gives me a glimpse of that throughout the year. Love it!",5
"I'd rather search for recipes myself.  Also, as a visually-impaired person, I don't like reading magazines this way.  That's my opinion anyway.",3
Great magazine and digital version is awesome!,5
"Political correctness kills a great magazine.  Dull lifeless teens flashing.
50 Cent on the back cover selling Effen vodka!! really?!",1
"I normally would not buy it, but a year for 5.00, could not pass it up.",1
"This is worth every penny, such wonderful and real personalities and new recipes that will be traditional favorites for years to come.",5
"I know in advance that I will be pleased with my subscription to National Geographic;
the downside is that the first issue is only scheduled on 6 Feb. 2014 (2 months later).",4
Not even worth the $1 per issue. Just same crap i read at 17 years old ,1
great deal---52 issues for under $34...can't beat that.  also the first issue came less than 30 days after i placed the order which was a plus!,4
Problem getting it started.,3
"In my humble opinion, this is the best magazine out there. It has great recipes, great short stories, and lots of good useable information.",5
I love the deals I receive from Amazon when I order magazine subscriptions.  The cost savings are phenomenal.,5
Best price anywhere!!!  Now I have no guilt extending my subscription!,5
"Same layout as paper copy, crisp pictures. The only thing I don't like is there are still the same amount of ads to flip through",3
"Buy this for my hubby every year and it's a hit with him! With over 50 years in publication, they've got it right and keep it interesting!",5
"Still a favorite - since I was a boy.  Now sharing with my son.  A bit too much credence on the global warming scam, but overall still good.",4
"I wasn't that interested in this magazine , I was looking for something more hand gu oriented.",3
Recipes are very hard to make. They want you to go and collect exotic spices and other items which are not available at most supermarkets.,2
Have always LOVED this magazine...Glad I renewed! jane,5
Just needed something to read on the can Over the years this rag has gone down hill. It's all adds and no articles,3
Crap magazine,1
Has wonderful quilts in every issue.,5
Would be nice to receive my subscription.  If I receive it I will share my feelings on the magazine sub,1
One of my favorite magazines for years.  Love it.,5
The ratio of advertisement to content was unappealing.,2
totally for super health addicts - not for my family,1
Was a great way to go but lately online issue not downloading right. Take for ever or have to go to manage page and resend. What happened? People also has problem,1
"My husband was somewhat happy with this magazine, but not as happy as he was with popular science.  I, however, picked it up and loved the political articles!",3
Not a craft mag. All about buying crafts. Filled with ads for pricey crafts that only the rich can afford,1
Ordered magazine for my son but I am receiving a copy also. I don't golf.,1
It is a continuous gift for our Mom.  She has always loved this magazine.,5
"Love my Practical Horseman.  Came even faster than promised, which is always a plus in my book.",5
I was completely unable to download it to my ipad so it was worthless to me --- I would really like to try it again if it would work.,1
I cannot get more than the one issue I already downloaded.  Have Prime reading free and the Kindle APP but I just kept being thrown to the annual subscription page.,1
The best in the industry.,5
auto-renewal is as big a con as  unions or demicrats. these guys have lived in the country if you are rich you can do what they do. real country living is nothing like this,1
I only received 2 of these magazines and then they stopped,1
Purchased this fluffy junk for my wife. She sort of glanced at it. Not much content...lots of advertisments. Not worththe 5 bucks.,2
Been a subscriber for a long time and it's not what it used to be after ownership changed.,3
"Not the in-depth, eye-opening discussion of history that I was hoping for, but nice enough. Perhaps it's because I come from a different country.",3
I was not impressed with the magazine and deleted it from my kindle.  It gave me no new info.....,1
Too many advertisements for me.,2
did not want to autorenew this tricked me into paying fo it. I am very very very unhappy about it now.,1
Perfect name for this magazine - truly something for everyone in the family and all kinds of activities. Excellent!,5
"what can you say? It is National Geographic, what an a abundace of information, what a way to travel the world from the seat of your pants!",5
"They regularly run articles promoting, normalizing and facetiously advising on abortion for teenagers.  Not something I will EVER let a daughter read.",1
Best price in town for this magazine and having it on the Ipad helps when on the road,5
It is not as informative as I hoped,3
I love Cosmo!  It's by far the best womens magazine out there.,5
Terrible.  It won't load the main stories. It says loading forever.  I let it sit overnight and it still never loaded.,1
"I have hardly gotten any magazines maybe like 3 in six months that I have had the subscription the coupons are not worth it for me, there are none that I use.",1
"I was a little dissappointed in the lack of meaningful content in this magazine.  Remembering how it was in the past, it seemed to me that there were way to many ads.",3
Magazine should definitely be less expensive for a tabloid in e-form....good to pass the time in a doctor's office or something though.,4
"Took a couple of months to get but thats normal with all subscriptions.  I love the magazine, has great ideas and perfect layout but Just too many ads",3
Great addition to my magazine library!,5
Love this magazine Martha Stewart is amazing I learn so much about everything reading it,5
"i love the price that i got it for, and my wife likes even more that she has a magazine to read over the weekend.",5
It's not good. It's not creative. It's boring. Can I return this?,1
"My niece was suppose to receive in March, now they are saying April",1
What's there not to love?,5
I love hiking and adventure and I love getting ideas from this magazine!,5
"Great price, great magazine.",5
It will be a huge disappointment if you are expecting the quality of a National Geographic. The thin content is hardly beneficial to kids. NOT RECOMMENDED.,1
"After 6 months, I still don't have the first issue. Wonder how this speaks to the age of the information.",1
This is my all-time favorite magazine. If you are into country living or homesteading then this is the one for you.  I even keep old copies to reference later.,5
"I am looking forward to receiving the magazine, BUT it's taking 2-1/2 months to receive the first issue!",3
"National Geographic has been in my family for generations.  There is always something interesting, and we love it!  Thank you!",5
Seems pretty liberal.,3
"Have been getting Veranda for about 10 years.  I am a decorator and have loved almost every issue.  I have saved them and reread them often.
This is the best magazine !",5
ok but the print is too small,3
come 2-3 month late after order and then missing 1 or 2 month in the middle....,1
All / too many ads,2
"I really love this magazine! It has great ideas, good recipes, interesting articles, good bargains, and i like the layout.",5
I rodered this a few months ago (like 3)  and I have yet to receive a copy....they took my money immediately of course.  I've been pretty patient.,1
Short easy to read articles that keeps me up to date with what is new and on the horizon.,4
I love the digital version and how interactive it is! Very user friendly and budget wise is excellent! Highly recommend.,5
"After purchasing on Amazon, the New Yorker sent me a direct mail to renew for $5 less than paid on this site.",1
A lot of great recipes.,4
Never received any issues,1
"I have been a subscriber for over 20 years and love, love, love this magazine.  Can't beat the value by ordering from here!",5
"Amazon took their time getting the subscription going, but it is a good magazine.  A little more ""left"" than most Texan's views, but lots of good article none the less.",4
Don't waste your money on this magazine. It contains too many ads and boring articles.,1
Got the bag no magazine though,1
Needs more stock reports,3

"Good magazine,  More content than most",4
"I've read Kiplinger's for a couple years now and this is by far the best price around.  Gives great tips on saving money on items, investing, saving, retirement, etc.  Great buy!",5
This is no longer a good publication,1
cancel my subscription. I am over it. biggest pile of crap I can ever remember seeing. the low class family,1
Some good information but a lot of it is old & if you watch your show you know what happened before the magazine arrived. fans want to know what is going to be happening.,3
I do not like this book at all,1
"a great buy and great service. Have purchased this for several years and they help me when I need to correct my mistakes in ordering.
Highly recommend",5
My boys love this and I loved the price,5
Not an interactive magazine which really is inexcusable art the point for kindle. Publication should be interactive like iPad versions,2
A student pilot must-have.,5
i CANNOT TELL YOU HOW THIS MAGAZINE IS AS ALL i GOT WAS A LETTER THAT THEY WERE BACKED UP ON ORDERS AND WOULD RECIEVE IT LATER. THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.  WHAT HAPPENED.,1
It's been awhile since I've read Wired but I just didn't like the complete outlook of this recent magazine... good articles though!,3
A little much for me - technical sort of.  I'm more or less a beginner in this.  At least  I gave it a chance.,3
Grandson loves this!,5
Best articles I've found in a magazine!,5
"Always enjoyed readers digest. Do not like new format. Maybe it just requires some getting used to.  Still reading it, though.",4
Best way to continue or start a subscription. With the best price.,5
Would be great except I didn't receive my Sept issue or any free clutch.,1
Nice patterns,3
Articles are not relevant to me as I am eighty years old and do not live in the U.S. anymore.,1

love this magazine..have been reading it since my teen years!,5
The articles are so in depth and hard to put down!  Each issue has so many good items to read.,3
value for money nothing to say. no fuss with this product it does its job and the quality is good.,3
One of the most beneficial magazines I have seen.  Every issue has plenty of helpful tips and hints and the projects are within the abilities of the average person.,5
Some issues come - some don't. Not again. I would not recommend ordering magazines until improvements are made. Only product I have ordered the has not been satisfactory.,2
Love looking at all the pictures and the stories are great! It takes you back to the good old days. LOVE IT!!,5
"For the almost six months I have had this subscription, I have received only three (3) magazines.",1
very good and thanks,4
Another great travel related magazine,4
I've always loved this magazine ever since I read my Dad's copies.,5
This is a great magazine for all Bear lovers,5
This is not the way I remember this magazine. Needs fewer ads and more self help info and/or articles. Boring,1

This magazine has such great tips and interesting articles.  I look forward to getting every issue.,5

"One of the best gun mags ever published, contains a good cross section of various types of firearms and shooting accessories.",5
I'm sure I would love this except I can't download it and I've been charged for it!,1
This magazine is trash. The articles give NO helpful insight and they talk about topics that on one likes. Save your money and buy Maxim,1
This magazine consists more of ads than articles. Greatly disappointed.,1
This magazine has a ton of great ideas each and every week.,5
have been reading REAL SIMPLE since it first came out! LOVE this magazine,5
STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN MY FREE GIFT AND WILL BE CANCELING MY SUSCRIPTION,1

Very interesting articles,4
Not the magazine that I used to read but think none are now.  Will only buy it now if I find a good discount.,3

"Good recipes, great picturers, good magazine for the price, have shared these all with friends and family and they have enjoyed them too!",4
"It takes too much time to receive the first book.

I haven't received the first book yet.",1
Always a good mag,4
"I thought this magazine was about science?  Rename it ""Global Warming Monthly"".  Honestly, they find a way to squeeze it into the magazine every month.  RUBBISH.",1
Could not download. Might be my server.,1
son loved the magazine,5
This is a quality product that is more than marginal. It is written in an easy to read manner. The ideas and projects are nothing special.  I would recommend this product.,4
We don't want the auto renewal,1
The price was great. The contents are well laid out. I love to read e magazines much more than paper copies.,5
so far not worked,1
this price is too high.  the paper magazine gives same content for less. kindle jacks up the price. what a scam!,1
This is garbage I don't know one company that takes two months to deliver. I'm sorry this is unacceptable. what a waste.,1
"It would probably have been a good magazine, but I never received a single issue, so who knows ?",1
My husband is a city famer at heart so it was the perfect gift.,5
"Not as good as it used to be, but still okay",3
My son seemed to enjoy this magazine.  Any magazine is doing good if it can keep his attention for more than 2 secs.,4
Entrepreneur is a great magazine to help keep a realistic thought process in business and life. All it takes is one good idea from them and all type of possibilities arise!,4
Just wasn't a fan of it on the paper where,1
Inteeesting.,1
I found quite a few recipe ideas that I will definitely try.  There was also more information on current topics that I found interesting.,4
"If you have an older boat that you work on, don't miss this great magazine. The folks at the Annapolis Boat Show who publish this magazine were great to talk to for suggestions.",5
"Too small to read opn my Kindle Fire! Too much advertising and I have not found the article i wanted to read
yet (Just Do This & Stop Aging)!",1
Very little actual content.,2
Got this for my Dad and he said he loves getting it every month!,5
I never received this magazine so how would I be able to rate it??  I cant even find a way to let them know I never received it.,1
Poor format is not easily read using Fire. Love the periodical but am glad I did not subscribe to the electronic version.,2
was NOT prepared for the money to be removed from my acct!,1
"I love this magazine, it's chocked full of to the point info. i'm excited to always get the next issue, best mag by far.",5
"After shopping the web thoroughly as I always do when purchasing anything on line, Amazon was found to have the best price, simple as that.",5
"Nice read, but it has gotten much smaller. It used to take me a few hours to read this, now it is maybe an hour.",3
My kids love getting National Geographic.  My daughter loves reading about all the different places and looking at the pictures.,5
"Digital copy won't play on PC.  Can't read on PC despite being a ""digital edition"".  False advertising.",1
Just right for kids from K-2.  Perfect size for a child to hold and flip through the pages of the magazine.  Great information and reading development.  Highly recommend.,5
Didn't like it !!,2
I would like it a lot better if it had a generic daytime schedule. It has a lot of interesting articles about listings.,4
Very disappointing.  Not like the original TV GUIDE.  No daily listings.  My 90 year old mom found it useless.,1
Got my first issue and have made several recipes they have been very good.,4
Rodale Press has gone from one of my favorite publishers to a plague which I avoid at all costs. Predatory subscription practices and nearly impossible to cancel. Stay away.,1
"Did not work at all. Efforts to contact Amazon to get it to work were met with no response at all.

Finally the hard copy arrived.",1
To much advertising.  Most of the pages are advertising for medical ads not one page but two complete pages.  I do not want to read that in a magazine.  Will not renew next year.,2
"Great magazine, all sorts of topics",4
"Many new ideas, informative....",4
Cannot read it.  Does not allow for enlarging text,1
Very handy to read on airplane.,4
"I like this magazine, but after a year subscription, it pretty much rehashes the same stuff as last year.",3
Great recipes but not so much if you're a busy person. Most are too time consuming for me.,3
This magazine is ok but nothing that really excites me.,3
Took a really long time .,3
Sure fire way to bring freeloading bed bugs into your life is buying used furniture from ANYWHERE. I'm even talking about junk to Antiques. No no and hell NO,1
"I choose four stars because my son loves it o the kindle, it was out first time using it on there.",4
Good value,4

"I like the magazine, but still have not received a print issue, as of yet.",1
"Not worth the money, was a subscriber several years back. The content now seems shallow. Better magazines around.",2
"Love this magazine, that's why I ordered it.",5
Unfortunately I rarely receive a copy.,1
Great magazine and quick handling.  A great way to purchase.,5
This is my favorite all purpose magazine.,5
"Nice but repetitive. No big changes from month to month. See the same over and over. I used to love this magazine, but now it's dull.",3
"Ordered this in May, it's almost September, still no magazine.  This appears to be a trend per the other comments, Amazon needs to step in.",1
My favorite fishing monthly magazine and at a good price.,5
There are an amazing amount of tobacco ads in this magazine. I expected better content.,2
I love Reader's digest. Great mini stories and articles.,5
About a month ago we order a subscription for J-14 magazine for my child. We have not received the magazine. I am starting to think we will never receive the magazine.,1
Horrible democratic propaganda. Nothing is worth reading in this overpriced pile of crap.,1
Too many ad's,2
You can't go wrong with Reader's Digest.,5
I've been looking for a quality hand gun for concealed carry so this magazine has helped. I also like keeping updated on new products.,4
"the best of the best, if you're into high lit",5
"my 4 & 5 yr old granddaughter love this magazine, order subscription for christmas and they are already coming. super fast",5
"Used to be an OK mag, but now it's just trash, filled with ads.  Worse than ever.",1
Received only a half of issues.,1
Totally unacceptable!!!!  I would like a refund to my account - This TV Guide doesn't display t-v shows except for 7 p.m.-11 pm-,1
"I have a print subscription, and I'm excited to have this on my Kindle as well.",4
If you want in depth bussiness news  ones a week it's very good. Less for not bussiness news.  Very American orientated,4
The photography is amazing.  Always some new place to add to our list of places to visit.,5
"way too many ads, print  too small.",2
"Mostly beautiful ads, very little content.",2
Out standing!! I love the daily reflections. It's a great way to start your day would give a 5 star rating,5
Generally provides a wealth of information; but it is expensive,4
Would have been 5 stars but there are too many ads.  Otherwise i enjoy it and it has plenty to offer for some food for thought.,4
Got the first issue yesterday (02/28/13) Enjoyed it.  Size if the magazine is thinner than it used to be.  But I will look forward to it,4
Did not order this. I hate magazines.,1
Not for older men !!,1

A little disappointed in the time it took for the first issue to be received but overall the magazine is satisfactory.,3
Entertaining,4

I just got my first issue and it was a great read from cover to cover. Highly recommended.,5
"A wonderful magazine for food, plants, and anything else you want to know about the South!",5
I like the magazine but it took forever to be mailed,3
Nice for inspiration but very high-end in terms of the products that are featured...,3
The amount of ads that are in the magazines is equal to the number of ads.  Would like to see less ads.,3
"Not as thick as they used to be, very light on content. Still manages to keep me interested with some original content, but it's waning.",3
...mostly advertisements and very few pages.  Not like the old days when there were many recipes to try.,2
As a photographer it is always a plus to check out the magazines for tips and tricks from the pro's. A+++,4
"Another THIN issue.  Hoping this was a one-time thing.  Will not purchase again, if this continues to be the norm.",2
I received a coupon from Amazon.com for a year's subscription for $1.  I sure hope it is worth it.  I like it so far.,4
I ordered this Magazine in early December and did not get my first copy until March.  The magazine when I did get it had no substance.,1

"I ordered this in August, and it is now the middle of November and I STILL have not received my first issue!",1
"i bought the American Girl mag subscription for my daughter when she was about 9, she loved it.  So. I now ordered it for my grand daughters, they love it.",5

Small print and inflexible platform.,1

One of my favorite magazines.  Read cover to cover.,5
"The magazine has improved over the years, but it's still a vehicle to sell franchises. There are some articles worth reading. For $5 for a year it's a no brainer.",3
"Not WHAT I was expecting,  to many ads.
CAN'T even cancel my subscription",1
Disappointed to learn that I can view my print subscription online. I've done enough with BGH.,1
I really want to give them 0 stars. I have ordered my issue back in Jan and still have no received it. I have tried to contact the seller twice and still no answer.,1
it ok just don't have time to read it,3
This is by far the best hunting & fishing magazine I've ever read. Highly recommend.,5
This is hands-down my favorite magazine. I love the west so it is great to read about the amazing things we can do here in our corner of the US.,5
"Too many changes to the magazine recently.  It has lost my favorite sections. I miss the crossword puzzles, word finds, Quiet Moments and Susan Koenig's articles.  ):",3
Articles were not interesting and to my liking.,2
I bought this magazine for my husband who is a network administrator and he reads cover to cover. I have no tech background and I enjoy looking at some of the articles as well.,4

Do not like the page set-up for my Kindle.  Prefer Comso's flexibility.  (why the hell is there a limit on how many words you can post-now thats dumb),1
light weight writing-mostly full of advertising-very disappointed,2
"I have not finished reading all the articles yet, but so far, I am pleased with what I am reading.",3
An exceptionally pretty magazine with lots o home decorating tips and photos. Mostly dedicated to high end designers but there are lots of tips for everyone.,4
love this book,5
Too many ads.  Cant tell ads from the recipes.,3
did not automatically renew - still waiting,1
I love the magazine.  But why is it going to take 4 months before delivery starts?,3
many ideas,3
For my mom. Kinda expensive items featured.,3
"If you're looking for a one-stop place to read small articles of varying degrees of useless info, this is it! I've enjoyed this magazine for years now!",4
Seems like this publication has gone down hill. Not noteworthy as previous years. Reviews marginal at best.,2
I like Digital Photo magazine. It has many informative how to do articles. It also covers new equipment,4
Great pric and an easy purchase. The auto-renew helps ensure I never miss an issue and I get a decent price!,5
I like this magazine but have received only one issue since subscribing a few months ago. That's why I gave it one star.,1
dissapointed,2
I've read this magazine for years now.  I use to get it in the snail mail now on my tablet.  Good general history.,4

primary language. I look forward getting future editions.",4
No bag...no magazine. I am still waiting.,1
one of our favorite subscriptions,5
Too liberal. Leave politics out of technology reporting.,1
Cancelled my (long time) subscription. Not sure why they feel the need to mix political cuck opinion (Zach Bowman) into a car magazine.,1
Do not buy ...I received 1 magazine and never received another one.....,1
Such a great buy! Very happy with the oodles of recipes!,5
"WAS NOT AWARE OF AUTO RENEW, UNFAIR WANT TO CANCEL.",1
Not able to download onto kindle.  :(,1
"This is gross, gives children explicit advice about having anal sex. This magazines grooms children for sexual abuse.",1
Quality magazine.  The only complaint is that there is no way to view it on a computer.  You can only view magazines on your phone or amazon device.,4
Haven't received any magazines yet since renewal so have nothing to report.  Last year was pretty good with interesting articles and recipes.,3
"This magazine is lovely on my Kindle 8.9, the pictures are so vivid. And of course I love reading all they have to say.",5
Needs to have a page with channel codes.,3
thats ok very little books for a year. why ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?,3

Don't really care for it.,1
"Once this magazine started coming, I attempted to find a way to cancel it. There is apparently no way to do so.

The magazine is mainly ads.",1

one of my favorites,3
Best news magazine out there.,5

Bias and anti white,1
Liberal garbage,1
It's great! I love having it on my Kindle!,5
This is an excellent source of entertainment and information for children with a sustaining interest in sports.  It has also exposed my son to other sports he hadn't considered.,4
This is a wonderful magazine.  Purchasing from Amazon was the best!  I highly recommend it!  The articles are interesting and well written.,5
"Since I haven't received the magazine yet, it is very difficult to review it at this time.  However, I can review the 6-8 week delivery time as a minus 5!",1
i like it,4
Too many adds!,3
it won't come up on my Kindle Fire. That's why I purchased it.,1
Gender is NOT a social construct. This has turned into a liberal rag,1
Love too keep up with the stars!!!,5
She loves it.  I love it too.  Reader's Digest is still true to its mission of timely information with lots of humor in a capsulated form.  It will be her annual gift.,5
"Love the magazine but its ridiculous to pay over $100 a year for a digital magazine.
I'll be canceling it after the 30 day free promo.",1
"I got this magazine for years as a gift, and now have ordered it for myself - love it!",5

This magazine is 40 percent ads and 60 percent useless articles,1

"No, not really good.  No organization, jus a print of their online recipes - there's been no additional testing or tasting.  Not renewing.",1
"Great patterns.
Full of creative ideas.",4
"Too many ads.  Too many ""Best restaurents, doctors, lawyers, etc."" listings.  Maybe one or two good articles per issue.  Probably won't subscribe again.",3

SO many ads now... I'm glad I didn't pay full price. Im 28 and viagra ads every other page aren' necessary.,3

"Well I orderd this magazine January 23rd t is now April 1st and I have not seen one issue. So, I would have to give this produst a 1.",1
This was a pop up notice from the Kindle app on my phone.  Seriously?  Why would I want a gossip mag?,1

I don't think it is all that great. I seen better!,3
"Just finished my first copy of Scotland, read every word  and am inspired to explore much more of this beautiful country. Great photography and in-depth articles.",5
Print magazine arrives late and no tote.  The magazine itself is great as always.,5
"Wonderful magazine, I am a subscriber for15 years and I love it, now that I can get the digital issue on my kindle, I can read anywhere.
thanks!",5
I don't like it,1
not quite what I wanted,2
Was expecting more style tips!,3
wish it was published monthly instead of bi-monthly plus it takes 3 months to get your first issue. Seems they could process your order quicker than that.,1
Made my 85-year-old father-in-law smile.  I'm his favorite.  :),5
Coastal Living is my favorite magazine.........love it!!!,5

Thought this magazine would be similar to Cosmo but unfortunately I was wrong. It seems kind of boring to me.,2

Full of ads like all magazines any more,2

Too many times they refer you to the website to get a recipe or additional news.  Why buy the magazine if they do that?,1
The articles themselves could be a little longer and contain a little more information to explain the topic more fully,3
i like the New Yorker fine but this version is flawed.  The screen often cuts off the title or part of the test.  Cannot read cartoons.,3
"Totally different from my other Hurst magazine ""Road & Track"". Good to get another view.",4
it was promised to extend my present subscription.  instead I am receiving two each month  that is unsatisfactory!,1

always interesting!,4
My granddaughter loves it,5
What a deal!,5
"When I purchased this it said a one year subscription, but it didn't mention that it is only 6 issues. They only send one ever 2 months. Very disappointing.",1
Our family had this when I was a kid - it has been a long time since then. Great articles!,5
This magazine is quite dull and uninformative. How about a bit more technique or something useful? Nothing left to say to reach word minimum.,1
I've ordered the Us weekly for a 3-month period. I have missed 3 issues already with 2 months in. Not impressed with its delivery to Vancouver!,1

I love this magazine--I'm from Dallas and it gives me information that helps with my trips back home.,5
Seems like much space is devoted to car reviews. Might want to look askance at the title of your magazine.,3
"The service is terrible Once they have your credit card you are hooked
Beware they will continue to reorder even if you cancel.",1
Break out the magnifying glasses so you can read the overly worded articles.,2
Love the magazine but never received the infinity scarf!,3
It is just too fussy for me.  I like recipes and these are nothing that I like.  I would cancel if possible.,2
I can read and peruse the entire magazine in 10 minutes.  Nothing of interest and the recipe section is pathetic.,1
I absolutely love this magazine! The price is great compared to the stand price!,5
"This used to be a great magazine for homemakers.
Paer is super thin and hard to turn pages.

awesome magazine!!!....i love magazines...this one is full of great info....and its cheaper than most of them too!!!!,5

Only teo of my issues came when i signed up for a YEAR... wrote a complaint and never heard back.,1
Great coupons and articles!,4
one of my favorite magazines....a must read,5
"Good business magazine, with good insights about people.",4
Do not care for the writing of the articles. Very predictable and boring.,1
Bag is nice quality and the magazine subscription fit it's purpose so..,4

Child porn issue - setting up kids for abuse - SICK,1
Poorly written and basically nothing but advertising disguised as articles.,1

best of the Astronomy mags and it will keep you very well imformed. glad to have it back again..thank you,5

"I though that this magazine was awesome, but not,
To many comercial pages, the content is minimun.....
and is so boring......",2
The new editions were not updating. Iif I get an annual subsciptions I want every months edition to update. Nexus 7.,1

Excellent.  Just what I expected.,5
Fun reading. Some advice are dated but it helps to be reminded that some ideas never change to make money,4
"It's okay as far as magazines go. But, buy it at the newsstand instead of Kindle. You kinda miss the greatness of the magazine on Kindle.",3

Wow.  80% ads.,1
"love money magazine, thanks for the free subscription",5
Our family has read Essence for years...We love it!,5

One of the best regional magazines ever.,5
This is an exceptional way of following the horticultural world in the UK.  It also has a wealth of plant-specific gardening tips,5
Misleading,1
"Just about everything you want to know about the make-up world is here. Highly recommend this magazine if you are interested in make up, special effects or beauty.",5

I love this!,5
"I would have thought I would have started getting the magazine by now. I know I enjoy this magazine that why I started a subscription.
Not happy about this .",1

ads ads ads,1

"I was not satisfied with this because I never even received a single magazine from this purchase, tried to report it twice nothing was done.",1
Advertisements,2
One of my favorite as it gives a variety of subjects!,5
Still one of the best general magazines on science.  Great way to keep up of a wide range of topics.,5
It's ok but not near as good as it used to be.,3
my favorite mag.,5
All ads. Why would l pay to be advertised to?,1

I have enjoyed this magazine for years!,4
Subscription manager options unavailable for this item.,1
"I love the magazine, but why can't I subscribe to it on my Kindle??? Why did they choose not to be available in e-reader format?",1

Magazine is great but we did not receive the free gear bag and have not tried the digital series yet,3
"I was so very disappointed in this magazine,waist of trees.",1
Great mag. Not very thick. Some good articles. Almost the same mag as the AOPA mag.,3
"perhaps a bit more instruction and final pieces, less advertisement?  Still a good rag to peruse.",4
This magazine is not worth it. You are better off looking at free material online that specifically fits your interest. Too many adds and biased material from sponsors.,1
"Pretty good magazine, Islands. Not enough pictures though.",4
I learn something with every issue.,5
My wife says there are some good recipes in this magazine..,4
Too many ads but I guess that is what keeps the price of subscription affordable. It is fun to hear about the latest scientific projects and thinking,4

"Decent magazine, but there is an full page ad for every page of content. Plus, most of it is about new cameras and other products to buy, not about actual photography.",2
the articles did not completely satisfy me. I did like the easy purchase from Amazon and quickness of loading on my kindle.,3

No matter the subject it will appear in Readers Digest.
It is one of my favorite magazines.",5

"My oldest granddaughter is 6 and reads at 3rd grade level...this magazine suits her reading needs,  The 3 year old loves the pics, posters, stickers, and games.",4

I could not take looking at this anymore than 10 minutes. It was full of articles and pictures of shallowness. Our country is in deep trouble if we listen to these airhead!!,1

The cons is that I have some difficulties reading the magazine the pro is that the monthly subscription is automatically download to my kindle.,3
"The writing/articles used to be much more interesting, plus there are a ton of ads in the magazine now. Not as good as it used to be.",3
"It is very pretty magazine but I feel it is only for professionals,

"Love this magazine, I have been reading it for 20 + years. I believe this is the best subscription rate I have ever found!",5
I like the digital format but  there are so many ads that you can't find the actual content.,3
I thought it was supposed to come weekly but I have only gotten one issue.  Could you double check my subscription,1
"Order the mag, Never came, I called Amazon, Never got it, Over a year now. Never heard a word about it.......sorry to say..........",1
"The subscription never reached me, so I could not read the magazine. I ordered it because I wanted a subscription extension and the order was  botched",1
My long-time favorite magazine.,5

"I purchased this magazine on January 21, 2007 and it has yet to arrive (May 31, 2007)  It was an expensive subscription that never arrived -- save your money!!!!",1
Not what it was years ago.,2
I used to subscribe to Guide Posts and have always enjoyed it. Over the years ads have taken over to good reading and shortened the content.,4
Excellent service and I would  use again.,5
I only received one magazine.,1
Nothing special,2
"Handy to have both version,s but honestly one or the other would suffice. I haven't had a situation where I had one and used the same issue of the other.",3
error words and format,1
This is the go to magazine for any amateur or professional weight lifter,5
My brother in law loves this magazine!!!!,5

This is my very favorite magazine - it helps me to dream and reimagine my home!  I share it with my daughters after I am done with it.,5
Could not tell if I was looking at a magazine or just a sales brochure for stuff.  Could not find any meaningful content in the publication. It sucks for a magazine.,1
Informative and up to date.,4
$5 for a years subscription to one of my favorite magazines. It came in like two weeks. Very pleased.,5
I havenot recieved any issues as of yet,1
"this was a fathers day gift... guess he likes it and enjoys the fact, articles and pictures! Would recommend to anyone",4
"It's unfortunate that it doesn't include a digital version with the print subscription, as so many magazines are doing now. I would give it a much higher rating if it did.",3
Flipped through nothingness,1
Featuring a fearmonger and her unsubstantiated claims shows just how credible this publication is.  Supermarket tabloids are less expensive and no less reliable.,1
great all around,4

Love the homes and decorating  tips, love english homes.",5
mag is 1/2 adds.  for self absorbed people who have money,1

Love this magazine! Lots of great ideas and tips. Also really enjoy the recipes,5
"We love the digital access on my ipad mini. My wife likes the print edition, and I read it on my iPad mini on the go. A perfect subscription.",5
It was just okay. After reading the one issue I've determined that I would much rather have the actual magazine. In the electronic version you can't do the crossword :),3
This is my favorite magazine ever!! Love all the NC info,5
It's been a month and I don't have the first issue yet so I can't very well review it.,1
Two year subscription to O- Oprah magazine.  This was the best price I could find anywhere and it was delivered promptly!,5
Not as impressed as I thought I would be with the magazine. Also never received the 15 free guide.,2
Vanity Fair is one of the best magazines.  The articles are well-researched and of interest to most I know who also read it.,5
I love the beautiful pics and always get great ideas.,5
Grandchildren enjoyed these with their parents,4
"Seriously Popular Science, I am done subscribing, I have been a subscriber for YEARS and it's like 99% ad's these days. Forget it, I am done",1

"this is the best magazine, and I just love it and so does my family, the love all the new food I am cooking for them",5
Too esoteric,2
But it was sent to wrong address (mine) which bugged me and it could not or would not be fixed.,1
Have not been able to get it to work.  Had to pay for it.,1
Excellent magazine. Great ideas even for the average home owner......and the Dwell Convention was fun too!,5
"Not the old Wired. Seems to be focused on clothing and people. Weird, not Wired,",2
"Love Bon Appetit, hate hate hate this app. It totally sucks. After a year I still couldn't even navigate from page to page. Ugh, terrible terrible app.",1
SOME ARTICLES ARE OUT DATED.. WHY IRAQ APPEARS IN EVERY ISSUE... SO BORING,2
I prefer magazines about self growth that don't have only perfect looking women.,3
I got this subscription many years ago. Stopped for awhile. Just ordered when I got my new paperwhite. Not much to it - would not recommend.,2
"Not much information, magazine is getting thinner every year. Not worth the price. What else can be said about it",2

"Marie Claire is Marie Claire. good price, though.",4
"I really like this magazine with its in depth insight into the PC and related software. If you like PC info, software, some hardware hacks and more you'll like this magizine.",4
Lots of heavy reading.,3
I purchased two subscriptions on the same date. The first one came and this one has not arrived yet.  I am dissapointed that it is taking so long!  Very poor.,1
Not sure why Im getting this.  I got a bill and the magazine all of a sudden,1
Always have issues with wrong mag being delivered to Kindle good luck getting corrected,1
"As a sports fanatic I always enjoy Sports Illustrated. It keeps me up to date in the sports world and sometimes teaches me something
I didn't know!.",4
I ordered a magazine in early NOvember and here it is December and I have not yet received a copy.,1
It was a bad surprise to me to read Times. I did not find interesting the materials and brought to me nothing new.,1
"A gift purchase for my mother-in-law, age 92.  She loves the magazine and misses it when the mail is delayed.",4
"This magazine does not contain simple country recipes that I would cook.  It is too ""uptown"".  I have asked this magazine to cancel my subscription but so far have had no success.",1
I love this magazine and it was a great price.,5
Love the wonderfully written articles and the fantastic focus on our wonderful state. We 'kids' renew it annually as a gift for Daddy!,5
Read The New Yorker in the past. The articles seem strange and disjointed. Some of the little snippets make no sense at all.,2
Grandchild loved this subscription  just for her!!,5
"Although I have a deep interest in history I found this magazine superficial and frankly, boring",1
I ordered this item more than two months ago and have still not received an issue.,1
I guess I expected more..,3
annoyed that renewal is automatic will not get again ever besides too much emphasis on high end bikers not normal casual riders,1
"Like all magazines, too many adds, but they have to make money somehow!",4
Find it hard to read and not the type of historical info I am used to reading.  Do not want any more copies!,1
"Though it does not specifically say what devices will support it, I have not been able to get it to work on my Nook Simple Touch.",1
Picked this thinking it would have more general information.  Would be good if you are a pilot and have an airplane.,3
I was hoping there would be inspiring photos however most photos are so staged that it is not practical in real everyday life design.,2
"I do really enjoy this magazine. It is filled with good stories, field instructions/tips, and pictures. My only complaint is that I would like it to cover more salt water fishing.",4
"Have always loved Vanity Fair. It gives you a peek into the lives of the notorious, rich and famous without being a gossip rag. Great writing.",4
Navigation is glitchy and some content appears to be missing in the current issue.,2
Way too many ads in this magazine and not enough travel content for the regular traveler.  I won't renew this subscription when it's time.,2
I never used this feature.  I'd rather have the physical magazine than the digital version.  I like the tangible feel of the magazine.,2
Nice magizines. Plenty of interesting  articles .,4
I enjoy the magazine especially movie reviews andbook reviews.,4
DIDNT LIKE,3
Two months after ordering the magazine I have yet to receive a single issue.,1
I love this magazine and always have. Great tips from readers and editors alike. It is also a good read which I did not expect,5
My daughter loved it and can't wait for her next issue! I will definitely be renewing the subscription next year.,5
Looks interesting,4
A lot of good recipes in it,4
My wife loves them best birthday gift ever,5
"This and Scottish Life are my little taste of Scotland in the US.  Coffee table quality, well written and beautifully photographed.",5
"Many repetitive recipes.
Hard to get through the process of authentication once you subscribed it.",3
Didnt keep,3
too much advertisement,2
Especially love the designers that tell why a specific shade of a color is one they love. I look forward to every month's issue.,5
I do not care for this magazine.,1
Love this magazine! Fresh and fun!,5
Not as good as I hoped it would be. I'm more of a technical person so only one issue so far has kept my interest. The WIRED email articles I get are usually more interesting.,3
I would be happy to give a better review if the magazine had ever arrived. I am still waiting.,1
OK recipes.,3
Barely has any content. Amount of advertisement close to the stuff being dropped to the mailbox for free.,1
It's good but doesn't stand out among the competitors such as Esquire and GQ.,3
My mom loved this magazine and cant beat the price compared to in store,5
I purchased this for my wife and she loves reading it. She watches for the next issue.,5
"I ordered for gifts 2 subscriptions.  Only 1 person received all issues, other person received only 1 issue.  Why?",1
I order magazines for our medical office. We try to keep magazines that appeal to both men and women. The Reader's Digests are by far the most popular.,5
"A great magazine full of recipes, ideas and information!!!",5
"Bad experience. These magazines are almost like 85% adds and 15% real info. I wish I could cancel this. By the way, they enrolled me for another year. Just plain bad.",1
Would have given it a 0 if possible because I could not download it to my Apple Air.  Send emails asking for help without reply.  Please give me a refund for my subscription!,1
It's changed!  It's all advertisement.  It's horrible.  Found nothing worthwhile in my Dec. issue.  It and the coupons inside were already outdated.,1
"What a waste..it did not reach my Kindle and I find no way to disput this issue.

Never again!",1
I love this magazine and it is so convenient to have everything handled for me. Great job!,5
"This magazine isn't bad, but it feels more like a printed forum for liberal opinions than a source of information.",3
I love this magazine. Great info and I read it cover to cover.,5
This and Smithsonian are my favorite magazines :),5
Its so rare that I keep magazines around.  Every edition is filled with so many easy recipes that you just have to try.  Worth the money!,5
Great magazine with many ideas for those of us living in the southern states.,4
A great women's magazine.  So many interesting articles. Can't wait to receive it each month. I love the garden articles.,5
"Everyone month, my daughter looks forward to reading this magazine!  It crammed packed with fashion and teenage issues.  I highly recommend to all teenagers!",5
"National Geographic is very brief and short not like it used to be.
Wouldn't recommend it.",1
"I enjoyed Cosmopolitan when I was younger, and I can definately see now that it is for younger women. The magazine is fine, just not age appropriate for me anymore.",3
"Mostly ads anyway, this magazine is only for the wealthy.  I have better ways of spending my money than wasting $200 on a throw pillow.",1
it was a gift.  but i love the magazine.,3
Nothing more or less than I expected,1
Worst magazine!,1
"I love the magazine. I watch the show whenever I can. So many great recipes, helpful tips. I would recommend this magazine to anyone.",5
Great for sewers of all expertise levels.,4
Lots of information and techniques.  One of the best magazines I've read in a long time.,5
This has just turned into a gossip and boasting magazine. No longer seems relevant for the investor.,1
I don't use the digital portion of this but LOVE the print.  I have been very impressed with the content.  I find everything very helpful and interesting.  Highly recommend.,5
"What can I say. It's Vanity Fair, the best in show.",5
Great magazine! It is full of great recipes and tips!,5
I really love O Magazine - it always has great articles and the color photos are excellent quality. Makes for a great gift!!,5
Do not like this magazine at all.  I will ask for a refund from Dwell.,1
This is an annual gift for family.  They asked for it and are thrilled to know it was renewed! They love it!,5
Can't say it met expectations even though it has been paid for in April but will not receive my first copy until July.  Not the best way to handle subscripons.,1
"I love this magazine and would love to get it on line, but there is only one setting to enlarge, and that setting is not large enough for me to see.",1
"This magazine has intelligent, thought provoking articles which are timely.  I am so happy to be able to access it on my iPad.",5
Considering the magazine will not download even one star is too many. I will be calling for a full refund.,1
Why does it take a week to make the Kindle version available.  i find it very convenient to read and search but do not want to be a week behind in reading.,3
"If you love cooking mediocre food with highly-processed ingredients, sure, go ahead.",1
"The magazine is great, but I never received the promised free clutch which I had planned to give to my daughter.",3
I am new to digital photography and am really learning a lot just reading this mag.  Took a while to receive my first one but well worth the wait.,4
I do Hot Yoga. I thought some things might be the same or interesting. It is very different  it is great if you do regular yoga.,3
Would not recommend!  Very dissappointed in the magazine. I cancelled It.  It is all product advertisement. Good if you are looking for product choices.,1
"Where is it? I would like to have it for my Husband, it was a Father's day gift for him.
walkerofcapecoral@gmail.com",1
wife loves this is exactly what she wanted,5
Always alot of practical articles for around the house. Sometimes has to many ads but overall pretty good articles,4
"No matter what price you pay, be sure it is too high. 95% of the volume are advertisements. For the amount of junk you get, you should be paid to just go through it.",1
Overflowing with unhelpful and biased gear reviews paid for by manufactuars and advertisements and really very little else.  Magazine is over 90% advertising.,1
Almost half the magazine is alcohol and cigarette ads.  Could not use them to reading time in my classroom.,2
I buy this every year for my sister's husband who's way into building crawlers. He reads it cover to cover.,5
This version of Barrons didn't work well in the kindle. The printed version just doesn't work the same on the kindle,1
Love finding magazines that I like at great prices!  Rachael always has several recipes that I tear out to try later!,5
Cute...thought it would be longer with more stories...only 10 pages or so.,3
OK articles. Should contain more  information on specific breeds.,3
This was a gift to my wife for mothers' day. She wasn't a regular consumer of the mag but seems to enjoy it. Good buy!,4
Never got the magazine.,1
What else can I say except that this is Popular Science!  Great magazine with great articles.  The purchase price wasn't bad so I decided to order it.,4
Great price....picked up right where my old subscription finished!,5

I like the actual magazine then the kindle version.",3
My 36 year old husband loves this magazine. He is always telling me about things he read in it.,5
"This is truly one of the best written, most interesting magazines available. While its appeal is mainly to Texans or former Texans, others will find the articles interesting.",5
"Not very impressed, at least with my first issue. Too many ads, not enough recipes. Will post an update when the next one arrives.",2
Digital issues take too long to post,1
This is a great magazine for anyone who lives in Texas. They feature unique and interesting articles about a variety of topics from the state. Alway a joy to read. Great magazine!,5
"Awesome magazine.  Always thought-provoking, extremely well-written.  I read it from cover to cover.",5
Not as good as I thought.,3
"Tried it, but nothing like it was a few years ago.  No articles RE anyone older than 30, so it's just for teenagers and young Hollywood types.  No substance.",1
I have always liked the magazine. The vegan recipes appealed to me,4
This is my favorite magazine.  Love the photography and the insightful articles.  Latest issue of containing a photo archive the best yet.,5

I had placed an order early January of this year and still am waiting anxiously to receive my first issue; it's already March!,1
my hubby loves this magazine. has lots of interesting articles to read.,5
There isn't much more to say. Wired has created a wonderful reading experience. I am sure they will find more ways to amaze. I would highly recommend this publication to anyone.,5
"One of the premier general science publications in the USA. It provides timely, reliable articles by practicing scientists along with fascinating and often humorous tidbits.",5
Haven't gotten a single magazine yet. Not sure what is going on or even that I bought this. Little worries to see this,1
I am DISAPPOINTED......I have tried numerous times to access this and cannot receive it other than the hardcopy!! Not happy!!!!,1
who is the demographic for such bland and insipid content?,1
I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. The magazine is interesting but it just is not what I thought it would be.,3

Refund my money.",1
I didn't buy this piece of crap!,1
Very fashion oriented good for younger audience..,4
"Its not what I thought it would be. I was looking for all things from 50, 60, 70...",3

My kids did not find this magazine interesting. I didn't either,1
"the best magazine out there in my opinion! great eclectic topics. great writing, i love it. i actually keep up with weekly reading (unlike the new yorker). great social media too.",5
If you like InStyle magazine paper edition it's the same on the Kindle. Great fashion articles and other interesting topics that wouldn't appear in a fashion magazine.,4
"How do I cancel, this is not the Maxim I remember or want.",1
"OK magazine, just a little basic for me  Not enough in depth on the cutting edge of science.",3
This is quite the intense magazine. Lots of step by step projects that seem helpful. It just doesn't seem as relevant today with all of the available free DIY resources out there.,3
I have subscribed to the nook version for a few years now and thoroughly enjoy this magazine. It has enough tech and what's new to keep me happy.,4

done with it.",2
"This is absolutely not a magazine for tweens.  Completely inappropriate content for 10+, middle schoolers.

It provides good details for a beginner in gardening like me.,4
This magazine writes many personal accounts of near personal disasters. It writes about very current items. I enjoy reading all of these articles.,4
"Extremely disappointed in their new version/format.  I have subscribed to readers digest for many years, but will not renew my subscription when it comes due!!!!!!!!!",1
too many ads the whole magazine is ads. I cant believe real men dress like that. I just read the product reviews then throw magazines away don't want anyone to think i like guys.,1
It was okay. If the price is low I will subscribe. It's nice reading it off my phone. I always have something to read waiting for appointments.,4
We love this magazine.  We do the road trips and have seen some great areas and scenery.  The magazine helps to give us great places to explore.,5
My daughter just loves this magazine.  She raises sheep and is a wool artist.  I get it for her every year.,5
It makes me sick seeing a boy in drag on my Amazon Deals page...,1

"Just ordered this for my granddaughter she loves animals, reading, books and learning so I know she will love this",5

"Beautiful magazine. Great recipes, pictures, and articles.",5
This magazine is mostly east coast. Very little west coast coverage. Boat and equipment usually on very high end $.  Doesn't fit my needs or interest. I prefer more practical info,2

Great value for one of my favorite magazines,5
Uneven.  There is one issue recently that was provocative and informative but the three issue before were throw aways.  I did not renew.,2
Good business stories with a tech focus.  Not as good as Wired but still a quality pub.,4
Why pay for a book of ads? There was like 4 stories and 30 pages of ads.,1
nothing domestic,1
I did subscribe but definitely will not renew. This magazine is out-of-style for my taste. But there's hope reader...buy or subscribe to Crochet Today magazine instead.,1
i just wish it didn't take 3 months to start getting them.. seems like that could be better somehow. thanks,1
Mostly product advertising.,3
Continually renew my sub.  Grandson love it - just as I did.,5
Not accessible as prime,1

"Our favorite food channel and group so naturally we love, love, love the magazine.",5
"Always has something interesting, but not as much as some of my other favorites such as O, and Woman's World.",4
Fantastic.  So glad to have this come directly to my home.,5
I'm glad that i'm now receiving House Beautiful!,5
STILL waiting for 1st issue to arrive!,1
The new format is a sharp deviation from what made them great. I'll be canceling.,1

Too many advertisememts,2

I have always loved Family Circle!,5

Got my subscription and halfway through they stopped showing nude models. Lame. It's like I got a half subscription at full price.,1
I'm very disappointed. I really like the magazine but have only received the first issue (July/Aug).  I'd like to know what happened to the rest of my subscription.,3
This magazine is a good read and it let's you know where the nice spots are that are open to the lgbt community as well as events in some cities. Try it I think you may like it.,4
Ridiculous that paying for the online edition doesn't get you access to the Kindle version as well,1
I ordered 5 months ago and have yet to receive one issue....,1
Every other page feels like its an ad. Most of the writing is pretty good. I wish they featured more clothing that didn't cost hundreds of dollars.,4
Enjoy the magazine stories. Would like more rides advertised.,3
"I love to ride my Mountain bike and this magazine always has some great tips, awesome reviews.  I love reading this and also going to their website.",5
Very good magazine but I really miss Christopher Kimball,4
Great ideas but the volume of advertising made it difficult to focus on the information.,4
My FAVORITE magazine ever! I look forward to each new one,5
"come on TIME magazine...i want to subscribe...but i have a kindle fire!  Available on all other types of kindles,,,how come not the fire?",1
Anti conservative.  I read false advertising it would be fair.  Buyer beware.,1

Best bet? Join an online forum and ask questions",1
Great magazine. It tell you a lot about survival and other thing that everyone should no about emergencies.,4
Just could not get into this magazine.,1
Item did not renew,1
not a interesting as i thought it would be,1
"I never signed up for auto renewal. There is nothing but ads in this magazine. A waste of my money, will not renew!",1
It was ordered by accident and cancelled and one copy came I glanced thru it and was  glad that I cancelled it,1
They started me out with old editions.,3
My husband loves this subscription.  He looks forward to the new issue every month.,5
I ordered this magazine in November 2009.  It's February and I have yet to receive a copy!,1
"It won't download, any of the issues, to my phone or my PC so the problem must be with the product.",1

I love everything about this magazine. Best birthday present ever.,5
I've subscribed to this magazine for well over 50 years and still look forward to receiving it.,4
Needs provememt,1
Great source of healthy eating alternatives.  Well thought out recipes and reviews of food/produce.,4
What a terrible magazine. A waste of my money for sure. Didn't get a single thing out of it. Would NEVER recommend this to anyone!,1
Not too much that really interested me.,3
Fluff and ads.,2
And there was no help available to get to access it! VERY disappointed! You REALLY need to work on this!!,1
"I bought this as a gift for my brother, a budding outdoor photog, and he says he enjoys it. I have bought a renewal because he said he enjoyed it.",4
Awesome Magazine!!,5
Have had subscription for years and then found the price here was better than direct renewal.  Continues my subscription without missing an issue and no overlapping issues either,4
This magazine has become way too precious for my tastes. I miss the really gritty fiction and raunchy humor.,3
"Great magazine in print, embarrassingly horrible in digital form.",1
What a fantastic magazine! There are so many diverse articles in each issue...,5
"Best magazine I've read in ages!  Awesome pictures, instructions and articles.
Can't go wrong with this magazine.",5
Some nice choices for recipes but not things we store in our pantry or fridge on a regular basis.,3
"This magazine has some beautiful pictures, but it also has a LOT of ads.  Tried sample to peruse on airplane while on vacation, but will not subscribe.  Got on my Kindle.",3

Gave as gift she is happy with it,4
"I DO NOT LIKE THE FORMAT, I THINK IT IS COMPLICATED AND SHOULD BE SPREAD OUT MORE AND NOT SO BUNDLED UP.  LIKE THE VERY OLD TV GUIDE USED TO BE",2
Love being able to get my magazine on my Kindle...,5
In-depth features not found. I expected better from BBC. For instance: What were the alternatives to D-Day? Who or what  was really responsible for the victory at El Alimain?,2
"Not a good value for me, it doesn't have good articles. In my opinion",2
great price for this magazine,5
"Be careful when viewing magazines online.  They started sending this to my address after I looked at it , but then bought a different cowboy magazine for a relative.",3
"Awesome magazine, with so much of health and nutrition info!! Love it.",5
Just OK.  I kind of like the old fashioned magazine.  Doesn't have enough pictures and not very easy to navigate back and forth.,3
There were way too many ads and not enough valuable content -- in fact many of the features were repetitive and seemed recycled. I'd prefer Bust magazine.,2
Very uninteresting and a lot of nothing. I won't be buying this magazine anytime in the near future.  Seems like it was all ads.,1
"When they had material for freelance or fiction writing it was good, I was disappointed in the quantity they devoted to poetry when the title boasts poets and writers.",2
Gift for my niece who is a cat fanatic - she loves it.  Thanks for the great deal!,5
Great price and magazine!,5
My only complaint is that I found way too many ads.  They should only use full page ads and add more content.,3
Too much Kardashian coverage!,2
"I have subscribed for a few years and as many magazines , more adds and less subject.
Very good photography, but not much substance.",3
it's okay...,3
Awful. I love this magazine but I only one issue out of the 12 months and I had to ask for a refund.,1
Good magazines but do not reach the date that is,3
I love that this magazine has a little bit of everything in it. I especially love the recipes. They are always fantastic.,5
"The magazine is fine but it took a long time for the first issue to ship and it was more expensive than if I had bought directly from Playboy, plus they offer gifts with purchase.",3
"Not impressed with this magazine, it wants to be allure, but very thin and nothing to read about.  Boring, boring , and Boring!",1
I liked the stories in the issue.,4
"I did not realize this is not a full-size magazine.  The small print is difficult to read, and doesn't seem to have much content per issue.",2
"One of my favorite magazines! Lots of great info on things to do, places to go and people to know in the DC metro area.",5
"cute, but not a serious magazine. Like reader's digest about birds",3
haven't received an issue !,1
Love the gorgeous photos that showcase many designers and decorating styles!,5
I am still waiting on my first edition of the magazine to arrive.  It has been 72 days since I ordered.,1
"Wife loves it, has good projects.  One month had a great recipe for marshmallows that we've been using.  Done many variations of it, and still love it.",5
I'm a retired military officer and this is one of the best unclassified and relatively unbiased sources to keep up with geopolitics.,4
I do not like the fact this is going to be automaticly renewed to my credit card without a notice!!!!,1
Scientifically irrefutable.  Fantastic up to date information.,5
Although I haven't received the actual magazine I have enjoyed reading the digital version. A good way to carry around the magazine's.,3
I have subscribed to this magazine in the past and loved it. The first issue I received from this subscription was very thin and mostly advertisement. Very disappointing.,1
We've found a lot of useful information on urban gardening and chicken care from this magazine. We're pretty impressed with the variety of content.,4
Very disappointing. I was expecting football information but was primarily about football cards. Would like a refund.,1
"Subscribed after some excellent cover artwork that I've not seen since. Coverage inconsistent... pro-something one month, anti same-thing the next month. Won't be renewing.",2
Good cooking ideas!,4
Quite disappointed because it doesn't have all the tv's listing and no morning guide.  Waste of money.,1
My son in law loves this magazine!!,5
I haven't received it yet!  What's the deal?  x x x x x x x x x x x x x,1
Yay daughter loved this magazine.  She looks forward to future issues.,5
I found the point of view from this journal much too conservative for my taste.  It is probably best for libertarians.,3
Don't waste the money! All adds and not much in the way of fashion or style that relates to the everyday woman,1
"This was a gift for my father... my dad is the greatest and only gets the best! Enough said, Right? Yep, thought so!",5
"Good magazine, with lots of interesting info and trivia on various places in Texas, and the way of life there.",4
I love all recipes and use the web site frequently. The magazine is very well laid out with more great recipes and helpful tips from reviewers.,5
I did NOT order this!,1
Looked nicer in the picture,1
"It's simple, Not the same as news stand but same price you should have it lesser priced to compensate the fact that your not getting the same product",3
"I have yet to recieve the first issue of my paid subscription. I would like to say,'great magazine',but I have not recieved one yet. I still waiting 1/24/2007",1
not what I expected,2
No problem with the product.,3
misleading - says full access - u don't get the web lookup site access .. only the magazine in paper and digital form,1
Very disappointed nothing like the past outdoor life magazines will not re-order,1
i don't like that its a running subscribtion,1
Has great advice!,4
Great magazine! Well worth the money. Yay freedom,5
Great magazine but WAY too many ads.,3
Excellent publication to improve your philosophical awakening..,4

Great magazine love the recipes I tell all my friends that it is a good magazine to get if they need to get a good recipe,5
Great magazine!  Daughter- in -law loved it!,5
"Enjoy getting the magazine, but rarely have time to read it!",4
Written for 90 year old men waiting in dentist offices.  Just awful.,1
Wonderful magazine great articals,5
"Wired is the best magazine ever, it covers all sorts of topics and does so with some balance and fairness.",5
"I cannot download it and I don""t know why. I usually buy books here and all of them were ok, but now it doesn't work. Can you help me?",1
"Magazine is a standard in the genre. Often times more expensive ideas than my budget can handle, so I have to look for DIY replacements, but the ideas themselves are nice.",4
3 months before first issue arrives. Unexceptable,1
I ordered this magazine on 10/7/06 (over three months ago) and haven;t received a single copy yet!!! STINKY SERVICE!!!,1
"If you want to read some really bad fiction, accompanied by bad art, this would be your magazine... WASTE OF TIME!",1
"Got my first one - even the ""recommendations"" read like ads -  I didn't feel like it had much real content.",3
Can't get digital copy,1
"Too much advertisement ! Not so much things to read.
I will cancel my subscription.",2
Great mag.  Outstanding price,5
Great magazine. Great source of information! Ty!,5
Maxim changed their whole magazine format and I couldn`t hate it more.......,1
This was given as a gift but he loves it!,4
It was ok.,3
There is always a problem with renewals!,3
It will be good if we are able to download audio edition,3
I have NOT RECEIVED any copies of this magazine from the publisher as of today's date (01-17-2013).  It seems to take a while to get the subscription process rolling.,1
Like most publications this is filled with ads and the articles aren't as great as they once were or my memory of the old Good Housekeeping is skewed.,3
MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MAGIZINE!!!,5
I get many subscriptions of different types of magazines. Real Simple is the only one I can read cover to cover. Every article is interesting and useful! Well worth the money!,5
"Best magazine for all midwest places to visit, wide variety of suggested things to see and do with gorgeous photos.",5
Apparently it takes 2 months to start getting the magazine. Im pretty bummed about that.,1
Great Magazine! Been subscribing to it for years.  One of the best magazines I've read in a long time.  Great!,5
Only got 1 issue so far and I like it so far.,3
November issue came with some page torn. Did not expect something like that!,2
The magazine seemed to be the abreviated version. Usually the magazine is quite large.  Otherwise it was more than satisfactory.,3
