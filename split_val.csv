"I have subscribed to Country Woman for many years.  Love, love, love it!  Nothing negative to say.",4
I haven't recieved a single copy so I can't really review it. All I can say is the amazom service is terrible.,0
Consistently one of the best mags in the world!,4
Love this booklet,4
Wonderful having daily mass readings anywhere you go and only a fingertip away.,4
Never got the free tote or special edition issue.,2
I love this magazine. Always interesting.,4
My neice and her husband really appreciated receiving this for Christmas.,4
"Not much new content and rehashes the old material under new titles, just read online sites and you will be informed",2
Just right for kids from K-2.  Perfect size for a child to hold and flip through the pages of the magazine.  Great information and reading development.  Highly recommend.,4
I like Digital Photo magazine. It has many informative how to do articles. It also covers new equipment,3
"I got the subscription last year, and I very rarely read it, so I didn't renew, but SURPRISE, they charged me for the renewal.  Appalling business practice!",0
"Wish it had daytime as well, also the smaller size and spread out the schedule the way it was, easier to read",2
Bought this subscription for my husband.  Makes a great gift for the man in your life and is by far one of his favorite publications!,3
I like paying money to look at adds for products. I think these publications would be free. I guess we all like to be taken.,2
"There is only a small portion that is not ads. Rather than keep the whole magazine I tear out  and file what is important. Sorry,but I was disappointed. Will not renew.",1
I thought I was ordering the kindle version of the readers digest....so I guess I have a confused review. Have not received digest yet.,1
Almost all ads.  Waste of $.,1
"The color print in the magazine is nearly impossible to decipher. I cannot imagine there is any positive feedback about this . I say, enough cuteness, go back to black and white!",2
Not as meaty as the Running magazine.,2
"I have long coveted this magazine.  If you enjoy design and architecture, this is an excellent magazine.",4
"My prime reading is worthless to me since I can only download to my Kindle.  Also, it would not open on my Kindle.  Boo.  Hiss.",0
I have been waiting way too long for the delivery of my first paper copy. and the electronic version is difficult to find/ access on a PC.,0
"When the magazine first came out I loved it! Now mediocre coupons that expire quickly and poor articles. No longer renewing this magazine,",1
Once upon a time WIRED wrote articles that focused on technology. The End.,0
"Gifted this to my Nephew and Brother-in-Law out of town.  Arrived as scheduled, they both loved the magazine.  Priced nicely!",4
Love ESPN!,4
digital won't work on kindle fire!!,0
I subscribed to Time because Newsweek went all digital. This is a good buy for those who still like to read...on paper.,3
CANNOT DOWNLOAD MAGAZINES AS A PRIME MEMBER AS OF JAN.25.18!!,0
Full of great information!,4
"My absolute favorite magazine.  The articles are helpful, relevant and short.  I always read it the minute it comes because the front always intrigues me.",4
Ordered this magazine in February and have only been mailed one issue since,0
I love this magazine! I read it faithfully. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the issues are not long enough.,0
"I marked it one star as I had to mark it at something.  I am having issues with my iPAD and unable to get the subscription app, so I canceled the subscription.",0
Really difficult to read in the Kindle version. Will cancelling.  I don't like the Kindle version.,1
"Ads, ads, and more ads.  Sigh. National Geographic used to be a cut above the rest.  Sadly, they are in the same category as SpongeBob Squarepants now.",0
"worst service ever, i never got not even one issue, i performed this suscription like in march, today is augost the 23rd, and nothing. I want a refound!",0
"Popular Science has a lot of interesting articles that are written in a way that anyone can understand them.
This magazine keeps one up to date on the latest science stuff.",3
Still don't like the format.,0
"Still a favorite - since I was a boy.  Now sharing with my son.  A bit too much credence on the global warming scam, but overall still good.",3
I did like this magazine but each one was pretty much the same and offered little variety.  I guess that's how it is with magazines these days though.,2
"I just love the variety, design and the way all the ideas shown in the magazine fit to my life.  If you miss an issue, the response to any claims are solved inmediately.",4
"If you have an older boat that you work on, don't miss this great magazine. The folks at the Annapolis Boat Show who publish this magazine were great to talk to for suggestions.",4
Auto-renewal with zero communication it was going to take place. A reminder or two would have been optimal.,0
It is my favorite magazine. Every single page is exciting for me. I also  recommended a hot book for the cosmo girls Sex and the perfect lover snd the Kamsutra by Mabel Iam,3
Best price for this subscription.,4
"Love the magazine but hate the new format for the kindle. And why can't I see my library of issues?  I wasn't caught up, and now they're gone!",2
"Love this magazine. No problems reading it on my ipad. Great price. Great offer. Would purchase this magazine again
Thanks",4
mag is 1/2 adds.  for self absorbed people who have money,0
"Ok, but I don't think I'll keep the subscriptions.",2
Always been one of my fav magazines!!,4
I ordered this subscription and never received even one issue. I don't even understand how it's possible that they could charge my Dad's card for it.,0
great magazine  but haven't received 1st issue yet.  Disappointing that it takes up to 12 weeks for first issue,2
Love this magazine in that it provides a  wide rang of scientific knowledge from behavioral to space science. increases knowledge.,4
Lots of ads and content not terribly valuable,0
I ordered this as a gift and it came to me instead. I contacted the publisher through amazon 3 times and still the problem wasn't solved.,0
One of my favorite magazines.,3
"Love it! Overall, the product was what I was looking for.  Thank you very much, again, for the this product.",3
Too many advertisements!!,1
where is the pictures?? and $3.99 for this? i bought a .99 book on here with 93 pages. thats way better than this. trust me do not buy it its a waste of money.,1
There is a Lack of content and they only sent me two of the 12 issues! Buyer be ware!  There is really no valuable info in these magazines.,1
To much liberal bias.,0
"The only reason I subscribed to this magazine is because of all the coupons that it contains. Some of the articles look pretty good, too, but I'm too busy to read them. :P",3
"Gun Dog is a good, but not great, magazine.  Customer support is very poor.",2
This wasn' the best reader digest that I have read so far there are some that I do like and some I don't.,1
Love this magazine and the convenience of ordering at Amazon!,4
Too many ads in the magazine.,1
Even though I cook a lot and have for years these recipes are way out there.,0
Subscription manager options unavailable for this item.,0
"False advertising, no more nudes, just another magazine with girls who now you'll never see naked. Way to lose your base PB.",0
Complete and utter nonsense,0
2 Stars  Like the magazine . Product not delivered as promised Ordered this magazine in September 2013 through Amazon with Express magazine only received one issue to date,1

  Stoll waiting for first issue.  And yes, they will get a call shortly.",0

I loved this magazine so much I had this subscription sent to my grand-daughter in SC.,4
Not a great magazine. Don't like the slick cover.,0
"best magazine in Texas ,or anywhere for that matter.",4
My kid loved it once he got an issue. He has only received one.,2

Not much content to this magazine. You really have to love tea in order to love this magazine. I like it for the table settings and a few recipes.,2

"First time ever that I purchased a magazine and this was so worth it. I will purchase the subscription now.

I don't do print + kindle. the magazine is okay has good reading,2
"Nice pictures on the Kindle fire, but too hard to read.  I like the magazine so I'll continue to buy it (probably in print).",2

"It's OK. Too many high fat, high calorie recipes.
Standard American fare.",2
great magazine for knife collectors!!!!  if you really really like/love to collect knives - this is a mandatory subscription,4
Too many ad's and not enough articles. Many years ago when I read Cosmopolitan they had some informative articles I do not find this is the case any longer.,2
Wish listings were by channel numbers instead of channel names although I know this is impractical.,2
Great mag and articles!!!!,3

It lives up to the reputation. Excellent magazine to share with friends at school. Great read for young adults. Can't wait for the next issue...,3
too much advertising too little information,0
"Same stuff, same products; over & over; not worth the money",1

"Love this magazine,",4
"Great magazine.  My wife loves it and pricing was competitive, but you can sometimes get a better price on the web",3
great magazine fast delivery,4
"If you are interested in advertising and reading about artists interviews, then this is the magazine for you.  If, however, you want insight into methods and how to's forget it.",0

Articles are not that interesting,0
too many ads.,2

"If you are a do-it-yourselfer YOU REALLY NEED THIS!!!

Great magazine...love the tips and tricks.",4
Dcor much too modern to suit my taste.,1
very good photos- limited content spread over huge variety of sports.  Shows difficulty print has in focusing content.  Where do you go after reading the one article on baseball?,2

"I love the articles in Wired. They are relevant, interesting, and educational.",4
I did not renew my subscription. The writing and topics just weren't that good.,2

I found it very sad. It was mostly ads for supplements and processed foods.. The recipes were uninspired and outdated.,0
"Great magazine. In magazines, print trumps digital",4
Great price for a great man pacifier!,4
Too many tasteless ads. I would happily pay more for an edition with less ads and more content. The fashion picks are great though.,2
Totally liberal and one-sided. I can't stand how biased this magazine is. Awful.,0
one of my favorite magazines,4
"I have not received this magazine yet from my order.
So I am not able to give my opinion yet.",0
Time magazine is so great! They always have well written articles that I enjoy very much. I subscribed just to use it on my iPad 2 and I donate the physical copies to my salon.,4

only the 1st 2 issues arrived. I didn't get August issue,0
GREAT GARDENS INFORMATION. THIS PUBLICATION IS FOR BEGINNER AND ADVANCED GARDENERS! FABULOUS INFORMATION AND TIPS. I LOVE & RECOMMEND THIS MAGAZINE!,4
I never authorized this subscription to be automatically renewed.  Oprah magazine STOLE the price of the renewal from me.  This is a very dishonest business practice.,0
Great magazine at a great price!,4
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET. THIN MAGAZINE AND EVERY 2 MONTHS IS WHEN YOU GET IT. DID NOT RENEW.,0
Got it for one year for $5. Now it's kn auto renew for $25 and I can't figure out how to turn it off. May have to call them...,0

I ordered this as a stocking stuffer for the boyfriend and he loves it! Looks forward to it coming every month!,4
This is one of the best magazines out there. The articles and advice are good. I really enjoy the jokes and the 10 Things You Don't Know About Women features every month.,3
Good articles but print too small for people who are visually challenged.,2
"Did not like the magazine. Too outrageous. Plus, they tried to charge me more than the initial subscription fee 3 months later.",0

I have been buying this magazine for my son-in-law for a few years now.  He loves getting it and refuses to throw any away.,4
I have only read one issue but so far so good. delivery was faster than any other magazine I have ordered. This will help our family eat better and take care of our bodies.,3
This was a good cycle magazine at one time.  Now it has way to many ads and little content.  There are better magazines out there.,0
Poor articles and tons of ads. I cancelled my subscription.,0
Worthless rag not worth the paper or even digital ink wasted on the publication.,0

One of my favorite magazines.  I'm trying to move to digital editions of my best-loved magazines because the paper ones have piled up.,4
There is not any guide for daytime television and the evening guide does not cover every channel.,1

Love it...so much good information!!,4
He says no torture for isis but then advocates for torture of republican reps women and children.  The very definition of fake news.  Amazon should delist,0
The magazine is not worth the cost of subscription.,0
Got this for my mom.  She likes it but over the past year there has been a large increase in the amount of advertisements and a decrease in the qty and length of actual articles,2
This magazine has such great tips and interesting articles.  I look forward to getting every issue.,4

I have not recieved my first issue at this time
It is hard to judge before you see a copy",0
Too many adds...,1
"It's nice to get Reader's Digest on my Kindle, but the pictures are too blurry to see. You'd think technology today could do better!",2
This is one magazine that is so one sided it is un-American.,0
Not as good as it used to be. Kind of disappointed in it to be truthful.,2
worth the money. good deal,3
I've only received a couple issues but I've enjoyed reading it although I haven't gleaned any valuable information that is useful so far.,2
"Their idea of cheap fashion is under $100. Thats not my idea of cheap, but it might be yours. this magazine just makes me want clothes I will never own.",2
this has to be the worst magazine ever... total waste. full of ads. nothing else.,0

I have subscribed to Guipepost for years; I love the inspirational stories.  They are uplifting and encouraging.  I highly recommend.,4

Can't read it -- the Kindle Fire version is intermittently terrible. the content may be just fine but due to continuing problems with my Kindle Fire I cannot read it.,0

Still awaiting for my paper copy,1
disclaimer - I am not much of a handyman but I like this magazine.  Lots of nice tips and articles.,3
Way too many ads; and articles that are broken up for a print edition --which is so silly and unnecessary anyway-- are annoying to navigate to in a digital edition.,1
How do I cancel this frigging thing?!,0
"I love this magazine and ordered it for one third of the renewal price. With every issue, I get ideas that I actually use and learn of products which I actually go out and buy.",4

"I had hopes for better content for my interest, its a good magazine just not for me and my interest.",2

Love looking at all the pictures and the stories are great! It takes you back to the good old days. LOVE IT!!,4
A wonderful opening to the world beyond the U.S. A different analysis and perspective.,4
Can do without the sexual covers but this magazine is filled with great information,3

Not as fun as Southern Lady. Pushing a casual aesthetic... we were hoping for something more escapist and fancier.,1

Great magazine and quick handling.  A great way to purchase.,4
"good articles and clear instructions.  Tends to not have the ""here's what I've done and I recommend it"" type articles as much as the ""muscle"" type mags.",3
I only ordered GQ mag to see the latest fashion trend but I still keep most in their original package,3
Love sunset magazine & price,4
This is one of the best Southern magazines out there. It's a mixture of Oxford American and Southern Living. Not too much fluff and puff pieces. I highly recommend.,4

"Does not allow text only views on the Android, so it its very cumbersome to read the extremely small print.",0
"My husband loves this magazine and looks forward to it coming.  He loves to see how things work and reading about ""guy things"".",4
not the same covers as at the grocery store. UGLY,0

I havenot recieved any issues as of yet,0
I look forward to every issue of this magazine. It has great information and beautiful illustrations. Getting copies in both paper form and on line is especially useful to me.,4

"The worst. No credibility whatsoever. Published fad before fact, and has no respect for the readers intelligence. WILL NEVER PURCHASE.",0
Very rudimentary publication. Would not order again.,0
Just a bunch of marketing trying to get you to purchase a bunch of toys. Articles are too short and it should have more on fitness.,1
Only received one issue!,0
Favorite guilty pleasure magazine. A designers dream book.,4
I only got 2 of the 6 magazine that I was supposed to get.  Unreliable!,0
"Dwell is a good mag but like any mag today, more ads than content.  I really enjoy their content.  Very original clean and space conscience.",3

"I am British and live in the USA. Love this magazine.....great read, great photography and well written. A keeper.",4
Similar to the New statesman but just on the other side of the political fence. Very enjoyable read,3

I have a regular postal subscription. I have tried ten times to add a digital edition to it. No Luck!!,0
"This magazine is the bomb...very inspiring with awesome recipes, photographs, etc.",4

My daughter has not started receiving the magazine. When will she start getting it. I ordered it in December.  ?????,1

Will not purchase a second time.",0
"This is a great magazine with lots of tips on anything from decorating to cooking to clothes.

"I love to scratch build in a world of ARF's and RTF planes, so this magazine is right up my alley.",4
Few out there. Euro mags are much better. US better step up.,2

Wow.  80% ads.,1
Didn't meet my expectations,0
I am so excited to have these magizines I love Rachael  and her recipes are great and easy to make,4
"I'm writing a one point review because I never did get the magazine on my kindle.  Wow I thought I subscribed to it a while ago.  Please correct.
Diane Boyle",0
My only complaint is that I found way too many ads.  They should only use full page ads and add more content.,3
I wasn't able to read it on my desktop. :(,1
It was a good test subscription for the promotional price. The magazine contains a lot of advertisements. I wish it contains more and newer articles.,2
Came on time and I bought it for my boyfriend who loves them! Was so happy they came on time!,4
Love the amgazine,4

Favorite publication!,3

I don't think they synced with my current subscription like they stated. They would ...so one star....I like the magazine a lot...,0
"over 50% advertisements, like a comic book, not a mag",0
Article missing!,0
I was able to get a year's subscription for free.  Even if I wanted to pay I could have gotten it for $4 (one year).  The kindle price is not worth it.,0
"I enjoy the coupons, the articles are ok/somewhat helpful. I've bought a few issues before and need a few more to really decide whether this magazine is worth the subscription.",2
It does not download. I haven't even got to read it yet. I asked for help and the link I was given doesn't work. Not happy. You guys have never let me down until now.,0
This magazine was a great Kindle read one afternoon with reading time!  The formatting for the kindle was also excellent.,4
My daughter loved her magazine. She could hardly wait for the next issue to come out. Highly recommend it for any child.,4
Does not come with digital access. The economist sells the Print + Digital subscription for less on their website. Deeply disappointed,0
Not the magazine that I used to read but think none are now.  Will only buy it now if I find a good discount.,2
About a month ago we order a subscription for J-14 magazine for my child. We have not received the magazine. I am starting to think we will never receive the magazine.,1
"This is a good magazine to read. There are better science magazines out there, but they cost more money. This is a good deal for the price.",2
There are too many ads. Just stick to reading Wired online.,1
"We didn't order it and I am having trouble getting it taken off my bill.  Not happy.  Love the magazine, but don't want it online.",0

It's definitely not the magazine I read when I was living in Texas,0
"Daughter-in-law loved this.  Great tips on decorating, cooking, recipes.  I did flip through one of her copies.  Would probably order another sub. for her,",3

As soon as I ordered this found out they no longer are printing the magazine.,0

Wish I had just taken it for one year not two.",2
"Not a bad magazine, but I definitely wouldn't pay full price for it.  I will probavbly not renew when the time comes",2

The paper this is printed on his practically see-through. I don't even think it would work for clip crafts. And most of the information is available on the internet.,0
"This will only allow you to view 2 magazines at a time on your device, the rest are stored in the cloud....the app was better....",2
"Not sure who's reading my Readers Digest, but it's not me. Maybe the mailman is taking it to his house to read.  Needless to say I will not be renewing.",0
Compared to Arts and Crafts mag.  This is nothing.  Money better spent elsewhere if you want ideas for a craftsman style home,1
"Always get at least a couple of must-try realistic recipes per issue, and lots of great information on healthier habits. Couldn't beat the deal on this one!",3
This is a scam,0
Not like the old Playboys! Very boring.,1
Another useless magazine.,0
Good Product Great Price - What I was hoping for,3

"Use
 To be more informative",2

"Pretty good, the recipes have been good so far, just seems kind of skinny",3

The only I don't like is that I can't book mark spots so I can go back and forth easier during mass.",2
