"I do not like the digital version of Newsweek, not a bit.  It is not handy nor enjoyable at all",1
Not the magazines fault but I thought it would be more based upon travel trailer reviews and less about destinations to go visit.,2
I love that I can open a magazine and EAT everything inside it. It's ALL vegetarian!! The recipes are clearly written out and the photos are incredible!,5
Not relevant,1
"Truly enjoyed this issue and the enclosed projects. The information was current and the patterns very well written. Packed full of ideas, concepts and educational articles.",5
People requires you to have the print edition to have the digital edition.  I don't have the print edition so I could never read the digital edition.,1

"I purchased this a month ago and haven't yet received any copies.  Soooo, the only review I can give at this point is their shipping is slow.",1
My first issue turned me off to this publication. It was police propaganda.,1
Came on time and I bought it for my boyfriend who loves them! Was so happy they came on time!,5
Far too many advertisements and a lot of the info pertains to people with rheumatoid arthritis but I have gotten enough out of it to continue to subscribe.,4

Articles are not that interesting,3
Only got 2 of the magazines,1

Hard to read on kindle.  Get the paper format if uou want People.,1

Sorry it, too, has gone the 'way of the wind'.",1

"Even though some of the stories may be exaggerated, I still enjoy reading about all the celebrity drama. :-) :-)",4
If you are like me there is no such thing as too many decorating magazines.  I have subscribed to this one for years and it is well worth the price.,5
I am very displeased with this.  I tried to cancel my subscription but they would not do so.  I do not want this magazine.,1
"It is not a newsmagazine,just not for me.",1
Not the same magazine you grew up with. Not appropriate in content for children. I cancelled after the first issue arrived,1

Our Granddaughter loves this magazine.,5

Time has become a political hate magazine; absolute garbage publication......stay clear of this trash and do not let political hate upset your life.,1
This is truly an unexpected Gem.  I found wonderful ideas on how to decorate my home from this magazine.  Really reminds you that a home is more than four walls and lot of stuff.,5
Too much celebraties. I'm not excited about who was where and when. I should have stuck with Vogue. W is a lot more hollywood conscious.,3

"Hi:
Hot Vws is a great magazine. Beleive me are more than 20 years that I buy this magazine.",5

"Interesting articles of local interest, but too many tourism ads.",3
It didn't meet my expectations.,1

Great ideas with food recipes!,4

Like most of these magazines the adds overwhelm and the articles under-whelm. Outside is starting to look like a glamour magazine. So sad it use to be a good resource.,3
"I was very disappointed with this magazine, and it frankly had no redeeming qualities.",1
Great magazine! I only paid $5 for a year subscription & it arrived earlier than expected!,5
I love that I see so much of my style and personality in BHG!,5
"A great mix of general nutrition , lifestyle , and exercise articles .",4
"informative; not too complicated; easy to understand; helpful to both T1 and T2 diabetics and families, newly diagnosed or long term.",4
thought it was just a regualr travel magazine,1
Love Vogue; loyal subscriber for years. Did not receive the the free clutch though!,4
"What a disappointment; don't waste your money, as it's 90% ads.  A shadow of the 1980's/90's publication.  Two thumbs down :(",1
"I love this magazine and always will. Great ideas, picture and articles.",5
Awful way to look at the magazine. Text doesn't enlarge as this app does not support this magazine. Buy only if you want to get frustrated,1
A nice variety of features & articles.,4
It's all ads,2
"Wish there was more fashion and articles, less politics.",4
i can't use all access. no tablelet.,1
"""This title is not available for customers from your location in: Europe""
If I want to pay for your magazine, why not let me do this?",1
"My 13 year old granddaughter enjoyed the magazine. Unfortunately, she lives in another State and we haven't discussed the magazine after the first issue.",4
This was described as 12 issues per year and the July and August issue is combined in one magazine with approximately the same amount of pages as a one month issue.,3
love sports illustrated,5
Great magazine.....great articles....great recipes!  My favorite magazine....I love all the monthly recipes and have tried many with great success!  You're gonna love it!,5
Husband loves it!,5
"this was a gift for, my grandson.  this is his love.  he is waiting to be  accepted at a college in Boston with his guitars.",5
"Received magazine promptly. I have read this magazine before and happy to be getting it at such a good price.
Amazon.com is always a great place to purchase.",5
"As always, the Family Tree Magazine delivers. It is especially important to me because one of my quotes was included in this edition.",5
Excellent accessibility. Vanity Fair is a wonderfully written magazine. It is great to be able to take this with me.,5
The pages are so small that old eyes have a hard time . . . also you can't print out the recipes.,3
I don't recall ordering this in Spanish.,1
stupid magazine,1
"The perfect bite-sized goodness.  A work of art, a short story and a poem.  I look forward to this every week.",5
I would love to review this item but I have not received it yet.  I don't know if I have to wait a bit because it's a magazine or what but I really hope I get one soon.,1
Excellent magazine have read it for years.,5
"Some good recipes that I will us, many that I will not due to my tastes.",3
much to many ads and less stories,3
"Is exactly as I expected. I also get Penthouse magazine, but they seem to concentrate too much on the aroused vaginal entrance and costs a lot more.",3
"I like people magazine. However, one of the things I looked forward to each week was the celebrity puzzle in the back. I don't think I'll be renewing my subscription.",4
Love this magazine....been getting it for years and have no intention of stopping it!!,5
"I like the magazine. The only drawback that I find, is that I am not able to read the magazine in my Kindle Paperwhite.",4
I LOVE THE MAGAZINE I DESPISE THE KINDLE APP. IT HAS NEVER WORKED WELL. NOW I HAVE A KINDLE 7 HD AND A NEW VERSION OF THE APP AND IT STILL BEHAVES BADLY. UNBELIEVABLE.,1
I used to save them now I throw them away the day I get them and will never renew after 50 years as a  reader and subscriber.  Hefner has lost his mind to allow this!!!!,1
awesome devotional. I already had the devotional before I placed this order. I think it's amazing,5
It cannot even compare to it's former self.  I have saved stacks of Women's Days from the 70s and 80s.  I will not save one of these issues - nothing worthwhile.,1
"too much advertising and not enough content.  was hoping for more recipes,  not ads.  this is like oprahs mag....  25% legit content and 75% ads.",2
"Very unhappy, Unable to get my digital copy on Kindle app without being charged again.",1
This is a good magazine for people who will believe anything. Do yourself a favor and move on.,4
"This is a good magazine for finding health and beauty products but it takes eons to skim through all of the ads to get to these articles, which is why I rated it 3 stars.",3
"I love reading this magazine, it has very helpful articles.  The digital format makes it easier to carry around from my tablet to cell phone.",5
sucks (period),1
Have taken it for years and love it.,5
Much easier than carrying a bunch of magazines around,5
Stupidest magazine ever and I can't get them to stop sending them to me. They continue to charge my account and I have to dispute it every 6 months.,1
I was able to get a year's subscription for free.  Even if I wanted to pay I could have gotten it for $4 (one year).  The kindle price is not worth it.,1
I don't think they synced with my current subscription like they stated. They would ...so one star....I like the magazine a lot...,4
This is a wonderful magazine..I've cooked 3 recipes from it and will definitely make again...,5
The little bit of content in the magazine is great. There are way too many ads in it now. I have a few years worth of old issues and they were great. Now not so much.,3
"Everything was perfect, great transaction would do it again",5
"This magazine is by far my favorite home-decor subscription.  Decor ideas are out of the norm, without getting so far out that they can be implemented in almost anyone's home.",5
Love this mag. Gives me endless ideas.,5
"First time ordering Southern Living.  Has many, many advertisements and a few recipes.  I am disappointed in this magazine.",2
I WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS MAGAZINE. WISH I'D BOUGHT IT OFF THE NEWS STAND FIRST.,1
"Good decorating ideas; however a little fancy. The subscription is only 10 issues per year, however, so it seemed like each one took a little while to arrive",4
Not what I expected...Will cancel.,1
For Hubby--not to my taste,3
I'm still waiting for my first issue. I ordered British Vogue directly from Vogue a few weeks after I ordered this. I'll be curious to see which one I get first.,1
i cant wait for each issue to arrive I love this magazine has tons of diy projects and tips,5
I hate it!  I couldn't get past the first 3 pages which were all pages geared to sales.  I plan to cancel my subscription.,1
"Absolutely LOVE this magazine!! Great articles, pictures, and ideas of where to go next for a vacation!",5
The most beautiful shelter magazine today!  Every issue has been thrilling.  I read it cover to cover and then pass it on.,5
"I ordered this in early July, I received one issue and nothing since. DONT ORDER",1
This business of automatically renewing a magazine and making it difficult to cancel is the reason I will never buy a subscription from Amazon again,1
"It's kind of OK, but NO big deal.",3
Pain in the ass to read this on a Kindle - and if signed for 30 day free trial. Good Luck finding a link to actually cancel it.,1
"WON'T OPEN ON KINDLE, WON'T ACCEPT ANY PASSWORD TO VERIFY ACCT ON CNTRAVELER WEBSITE. FORGET THIS ONE!",1
Good overall coverage but could use one or two extra stories on professional Lacrosse.,4
The daily Republi-con talking points begin with the drug report then are repeated by druggie Limbaugh. Save yourself the money.,1
"This is a great source of info on Tv, movies, music, and other forms of entertainment. You can't go wrong",4
"I may cancel this subscription. Somehow, I remember it being much better, a bit disappointed. Bring back the old curve!",2
"At first liked her magazine, but find each issue is always the same with the same commentators and same style. Will not renew.",3
"After a nasty hate filled blog post on Marie Claire's website, I will no longer subscribe to this publication until their editor and the author of the blog post are dismissed!",1
Do not use on the Kindle - wish I could delete it to free up space.,1
I LOVE this magazine!,5
I love having both the print and electronic version!,5
Great Stories.,4
"Excellent writing, top reporting and best cartoons",5
I love this magazine.  It's full of good articles and tips and coupons.  This is one magazine you will always want to continue getting.,5
"This magazine should be titled ""Sailing boats"". It is all about sailboats and sailing equipment.",1
"Informative articles aimed at the beginner. Ads, ads and more ads but they pay the bills. Worth subscribing to. Very Australian orientated.",4
Fantastic,5
"It's just screen shots of the magazine on the fire, not individual articles. I think I'd rather read it on paper....",3
Only got half of the issues. Very small booklet not a magazine at all. Nice pictures though.,2
Love this company and this magazine. We are big foodies!,5
Received my first two issues on the same day. One i had already purchased a month earlier and the other was the prior months issue! I won't buy subscriptions from here anymore.,1
Very difficult to read Time Magazine on Kindle. Very bad choice! I wouldnot recommend it to anyone at all. I regret my choice.,1
Great service. Great magazine for my salon. Love the auto sign up,5
"Loved this magazine during my college days, but then I grew up.  Now I am no longer entertained by half-dressed women, dozens of ads or fashion advice.",3
"A classic, somewhat updated, quick reads, still positive uplifting stories",4
"This magazine is enjoyable and has a lot of research behind it, though somewhat repetitive because of the advertising factor.",4
I think there are a lot of useless articles.  The cabbage recipes were unappetizing.  I was glad I didn't buy it.,2
"I ordered 12/16/09, as if 02/12/10 (8 weeks) I haven't received the first issue.  It's taking too long.",1
Both my girls Love this mag and this was a great deal,5
Only received ONE copy. Sux!,1
"Love,love,love this magazine!!",5
"I have been a BHG reader for years.  I love the decorating ideas, gardening tips and great recipes, and now I love the great price!",5
Love the big words so much easyer to read when elder people are ageing i belive it helps us all to read good stores.,5
"Really, this is an exciting style, but you'd never know it from this magazine! Is the the refusal to add any other style that makes
it so stagnant?",1
Ratio of advertising to articles and ideas is 15-1.  So sad.,1
I have not yet received this item!!!!  It was ordered almost two months ago and yet to receive a copy!,1
1st issue received. So far so good.......,4
This has been an ongoing gift. The recipient loves this magazine over many others. The price is always good to excellent .,5
"My son just bought a house & loves watching ""This Old House"".  This was the perfect gift for a new home owner!",5
"My daughter is only 6 years old. It's a good magazine, but she's a bit young for it.",3
I still have not received anything. The only thing that was done on time was your billing on my credit card. I want a credit back. PLEASE,1
I ordered this magazine along with another.  The other magazine came one month before this one.  I don't understand .....why so late.,1
It's an okay magazine...not exactly what I was looking for.,3
Great magazine many helpful articles very informative,4
My all time favorite fishing magazine.  Wonderfully written articles in every issue.,5
"Definite room for improvement... they are still sending my magazines to my parent's house, after repeated phone calls and account updates.",1
Awful. Receiving SI for kids. Not as advertised. I don't have children. It goes straight into the garbage.,1
I only got 1 issue.,1
Too much emphasis on writers and fans. Not enough written word. It's a fanzine. Yuck!,3
I am so happy to have subscribed thru Amazon. The magazine delivery started in 2 weeks.,5
The best magazine in Spanish!!,5
This magazine is an excellent way to escape the madness of our daily news. Photographs are excellent,5
If you love cars then you can't go wrong with this subscription!,5
Decent magazine. Variety of content. Advertised clothes are stupidly overpriced though.,3
Nothing wrong with the magazine it's great but it took a month or so longer than it said till I received it. ;(,3
"I love this magazine.  It is a great price and covers a variety of topics from recipes to coupons to exercise, make up tips and soduku",5
I have been a great fan of The Reader's Digest for about 40 years now. It never disappoints!,5
75% of this magazine is advertisements.,2
why must u put all the crap about medical info & side affects  what happen to just what the book is about????  I don't like it!!,1
Not what I hoped for,2
"Auto-renewed billed 4x what was paid in year 1 for the year 2 of a magazine that offers lots of great photography, almost nothing on recipes and technique.",1
My favorite self help magazine; and it was cheaper to order from Amazon.,5
Hubby likes it,4
"First time ever that I purchased a magazine and this was so worth it. I will purchase the subscription now.
thanks,",5
I will not be renewing.  This magazine is such a quick read that I will leave it to physician reception areas.,3
"Always something interesting, been reading it for years.",5
"Excellent service, neatly packaged, arrived when they said it would. I would buy from this vendor again. I have always had positive transactions from Amazon vendors.",5
"I did not realize it was ""Auto- Renewal""  Watch your bank account for the following year.  They were nice and stopped the subscription.  I had 3 bought .",1
"New York Magazine is very interesting, if you live or work or frequently visit New York.  Otherwise I much prefer Atlantic or Harpers.",2
"Love love this magazine!! Positive, wholesome, good stories as well as recipes and much more!",5
some issues contain useful informations but some others are just useless...,3
Who doesn't love Football and Fine Foreign Fannies?!!,5
Great Magazine always has helpful hints coupons in it I love couponing and this is the magazine for coupon lovers!,5
Reader's Digest is a classic and love the short stories and funny columns.  A quick read you can put down and pick up whenever you have a moment,5
I don't want this magazine anymore and am trying to switch or cancel but you won't let me.  Not happy!!!!!!,1
"Who doesn't love National Geographic! They are great magazines to collect, and absolutely no trouble with the subscription or renewing it.",5
Not the quality of magazine it was years ago.,1
"I'd prefer to be able to renew or not on My say-so, and not just be automatic. Can you fix it for me?",3
I love to cook and this is a magazine where I keep recipes and share them with family.,5
not the same covers as at the grocery store. UGLY,1
The best.  I'm so glad it exists.,5
I will always have a subscription to this magazine.  process easy.  Love it.,5
I have been billed but don't have the magazine on my Android tablet yet.  they are trying to help me.,1
Wonderful insightful magazine with so much to offer the reader.,5
WE love this magazine!  The price is so reasonable and the photos are gorgous.  They make a lovely addition to your coffee table.,5
Just another dirt rag,1
my honey loves this magazine.  it's great for the price.,5
My grandson loved his subscription. Very educational and fun at the same time.,5
"I wanted the writing to be cowboy writing. It wasn't. It was modern writing of cowboy stories.
I did not enjoy it.",1
Way overpriced,2
I have been waiting a long time to get Consumer Reports in digital form. Thanks to Amazon my wait is over. I am totally enjoying this.,5
Basically a recipe magazine cookbook with pics.,1
"1st issue was nothing but food,  i was really disappointed",1
This magazine sucks!  Dont waste your money,1
Love sunset magazine & price,5
A month later still not one issue.  Go direct.,1
Great magazine.  My company also enjoys the articles.,5
"Nice, but I prefer Verandah and Traditional Home as they are more realistic. Also, the digital version never worked.",3
I got this as a gift for my brother for Christmas and he loved it!,5
The magazine has interesting articles as long as you overlook the obvious liberal bias and BS.,4
Husband and both of my boys really love science and technology and this magazine keeps them occupied for hours!,5
I did not receive the free tote.,1
Not worth the huge price tag.,1
"Easy enyertainment for lazy days:) Articles about fashion, topic releveant for most women especially in the age 18 -30 , and some celebrity gossip",4
My daughter loves it BUT VERY INCONSISTENT WITH DELIVERY,2
Too many adds.,3
"I don't like it, is obly about adds",1
Loved the book. But was very disappointed that I couldn't copy my patterns.  Won't be buying e magazines for this reason,3
I was disappointed in the magazine due to it was mostly advertisements.  For me it was a waste of money.,1
I did not get all copies and some came late. Will discontinue,2
This magazine offers a variety - fantasy and science fiction.  The stories vary in length from novelets to short stories.  I've been reading it for over 50 years!,5
Got this for my nephew who loves it!,5
"This is my favorite magazine. They have the best workouts, advice and meal plans. I love the inspiration this magazine gives me!",5
Too many commercial ad instead of quality articles so stop subscribing it any more.,1
my family loves this magazine,5
I was excited to learn the Economist was on the Kindle but there are no archived issues?  I only wanted LAST week's issue and can't even access it.  That's frustrating.,1
"I love the simplicity, variety, and all around deliciousness of the recipes. I enjoy the articles and the convenience of my online subscription.",5
"Good read, good information, but articles tend to be biased.",4
Great! I love it!,5
Downloaded this to my android tablet. It opened for 2 seconds then closed. Downloaded again - same problem. I bought Clarkesworld and Galaxy at the same time and those are fine.,1
NEVER  got  one issue.  pjs,1
"I have not received this magazine yet????? When will I receive it????

Thanks, Denise",1
Great price the mag speaks for itself,5
"I grew up in south Louisiana and i love the food there. This is one of my favorite magazines and my daughtes ,too. We look forward to it ,I hope it is around always.",5
"Pretty decent magazine, good recipes and colorful covers. Also good articles.",4
"Fantastic magazine, and it works great on Kindle for Android now. I love it! I prefer this format to paper magazines these days, anyway.",5
I was able to download this one time. After that it would download 1 percent and that's it.  I tried everything I could think of but nothing. Does not work.,1
This magazine was not interesting nor in my opinion not well organized. I would not recommend it to any one,2
Great publication. I enjoy reading it each issue.,4
interesting magazine for DYI'ers...,4
A magazine without backbone - disappointed. Will never purchase or subscribe again.,1
I reviewed this magazine low because it contains mostly advertisements. This was disappointing! It would be nice to see more useful articles and recipes.,2
Just beautiful.  The pages display wonderful images that take me back home.  The price is extremely affordable.  I highly recommend subscription.,5
"Gift Subscription, well loved by recipient!",5
it is june ordered in April so until I get a magazine hey get only 2 stars for being slow,1
"Good magazine.  Great ideas, good work and good articles.  Enjoy it!",4
Lucky this was only $5 for a year.  This publication hasn't aged well.,3
I prefer simple recipes,3
A lot of advertisements.,3
Husband liked it okay.,3
Nobody likes your crap magazines.,1
I liked the older version better since I was able to access older copies much easier than with the new one.,3
This magazine changed over the years. It went from reat good stories and advice to just a bunch of gossip and nonsense.,2
Just ok.......not too much out of the ordinary!,3
"Too many ads.  Not enough content.  Very pricey!!!  Also, it auto renews!!",2
"What was favored is the following: fast sign-up and download for Vogue, magazine layout, and information well worth reading.",4
Quack science meets cheesy health magazine format.,1
I love this publication since I was a child,5
I bought the magazine as a gift and the person I gave it to (a millenial!) never signed up for the online access.,1
I have been a subscriber for years. Love this magazine. Detailed projects. Good variety of articles. I always get something out of every issue.,5
I purchased this magazine when my children were little and now I am a proud grandma and revisited this magazine which I still enjoy.  Thank you for the wonderful Family Fun ideas.,5
I didn't know what to expect; but it is a nice magazine,3
got it for my husband but he never gets around to reading it,3
I got sent two issues that I had already bought from the news stand. Would have liked to choose when my subscription would start without receiving issues I bought twice.,1
"This item was ordered as a Mother's Day gift, and has not yet (as of 5/29) been received",1
Nothing but ads.  My daughter really didn't like it at all.,1
Reader's Digest always makes a great gift for anyone! I've been reading it for almost seventy years and never get tired of it.,5
Good read has many interesting articles,4
Excellent inspirational magazine. I recommend this for everyone.,5
"Just like its predecessor, Dog Fancy, it's written to the dumbest audience.",3
Ready great format for tablets,5
We bought this subscription as a gift for our 16 year old daughter without having seen an issue of it. There was way too much (sexual) info in it. Cancelled it.,1
I received 4 of the same issue.,1
"This Kindle version must be specifically for Kindle Fire because I could not load it up on my Android, Kindle, or Nexus 7, only my iPod. So beware.",1
Immediately after ordering a subscription I started getting harassing phone calls from National Geographic.,1
I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN THIS MAGAZINE TOO,1
Feels extremely repetitive with their articles. I feel like I am reading the exact same thing over and over again.,2
I ordered the one year subscription (non auto-renewal).  I received four issues and then it stopped.  Okay...it was only eight bucks but this is bogus!,1
Far left very fake news,1
Love this country style.,5
Disappointed by poor quality of paper,1
I think there are better fashion / beauty magazines available. There should be more substance.,3
Value for money spent,3
First time viewing from Kindle....sweet!,3
"love ""The New Yorker""...I love the in depth articles...I learn a lot",5
I renewed this subscription on 11/30/2013 and the magazine did not get the payment until the end of January 2014.  Two months is way too long.,1
I liked it; just never had enough time to read it very consistently.,4
a LARGE waste of TIME and MONEY!!!!,1
On time and a great mag. Many projects and handy tips! Can't wait for the next issue. Thanks for a great mag.,4
Still trying to find time to read the newest issue.  So far so good.,4
I love this magazine so much such a great one. I look forward to getting mine in the mail every month.,5
Great magazine. So much useful content.,5
I only actually received one addition when there were supposed to be a few.,1
"articles ok, however as a person with low vision in one eye, the glossy pages are hard to read and the print seemed small.",3
Its a great deal.,5
Perhaps I mixed this up with a similar magazine but the first 2 issues we received very totally devoted to a few areas that have no interest to us,1
This a great magazine for the inquisitive with lots of fun facts and mentally stimulating stories. It was one of the best subscriptions we've had.,5
Love this magazine. Great price,5
Physical quality of magazine is a great disappointment.,1
Still cannot access account. Very disappointed. Wish Amazon or publisher would make this right for me.,1
Nice magazine and has lots of pictures and helpful info  I'm glad I found it.,4
The last 2 months this magazine would not download.  So I paid for items I couldn't even open up,1
I have never been disappointed with any receipt I have tried. Southern Living always has interesting decorating ideas and shopping articles. Great buy from Amazon.,5
"primarily, a bunch of advertizements.",2
Actually I have not received this magazine yet. Could you please help me to check it? Thanks.,1
Just wasn't what I thought it was,3
DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! PUBLISHER HAS FOLDED AND THE FINAL ISSUE IS ALREADY AT NEWS STANDS!!!!!!!!,1
I didn't get a tote bag. But I enjoy glamour magazine,3
I used to love this magazine when it first came out. Now it takes me about 5 minutes to flip through it because so much of the content is a joke.,2
I bought this to have the digital copy on my kindle - less clutter - but it is taking forever to download.  I have been waiting all day and I only have the top.,1
Wonderful price for the auto renewal on US Weekly!  You can't beat it!,5
"I was very pleased with this purchase and will be happy to purchase from Amazon again.

Thanks again,
Bonnie",5
"Great magazine but as other reviews have said, the print is pretty small.",4
BS Rag Mag!,1
The recipient of this gift is an avid reader and is very excited to receive this gift. She will love it.,5
"Ordered this on December 9th and now Jan 25th. I would get my wife to review her gift, but since it still hasn't arrived then she can't. Draw your own conclusions.",1
"Fast and inexpensive, love it.  Makes much more sense than to pay full price at the counter of some store.",5
"When the renewal starts since I purchase it.
The letter came yesterday to renewal it so now do it.",3
"My grandson only received 3 magazines and as of the date 03/11/18, still trying to settle this.",1
LOVE LOVE LOVE this magazine.  Has interesting and helpful articles.  Great recipes for any age.  Enjoy making things with grandchildren and nephew.,5
Soaps in Depth is the best soap magazine on planet earth!,5
"Flowers. Potted plants. Back yards. Food. Bricks. Smart clothing. Islands in kitchens. Home Depot paint. Shovels. So, why did we subscribe? The wife loves all of these.",5
Have received one copy - should've received three by now.  Love the magazine - distribution is an issue apparently,3
"There was information on amazon's wevsite that the subscription could be used with Next Issue app but that is not true. Otherwise, it worked with nook.",1
Totally USA centred. No use for Europeans or anyone else of the billions outside the USA to read.,1
Hard to change address. Haven't seen an issue yet so apparently still hasn't worked. I will try again and then go back to finding a copy at bike stored every so often.,1
Not worth it now that  Flat Earther Murdock bought it.,1
"Will not download completely. Cannot scroll. Almost useless.
However, the imbedded clips in the fragments I do have look
Like they would be great.",1
"I forgot to renew my subscription in a timely manner, but this went thru very quickly. I did not miss an issue (in the last 50 years) ! Price was great also.",5
"i luv this magazine so much :) i hope they never stop putting these magazines  on stock !
love always,
the awesome sam",5
"Great, Awesome, Amazing!!!",5
Both my son and nephew love this magazine and read it cover to cover every month!,5
"Terrific gift for grandson who LOVES cars!  Subscription started, as planned, and it keeps on giving all year!",5
Just shotty print. Sensationalism at best,5
One of the best magazines in the field worth every cent.  A publication to enjoy.,5
I enjoy the articles . The mind/brain is amazing,5
Love being able to double tap to have the page zoom automatically. Great magazine,5
Hands down the best gift I have ever gotten someone and since we live together I get to read them too!,5
Tells you about anything and everything you want to know!! LOVE IT!,5
good publication- very informative and unbiased,4
Purchased this to read the article on great summer trips.  I was disappointed with their selections.,1
"and it works just fine but what a colossal waste to send me the print version. I don't need both versions, and I probably won't renew my subscription.",1
NOT THE NATIONAL GEO I REMEMBER ALL ADS LITTLE CONTENT I THROWWITHOUT READING. Used to love it.,1
It's an OK magazine for the price. Good things in it but it isn't great  quick read and a few good recipes or ideas.,3
Not as informative as I had hoped but a good resource,3
This magazine is nothing but adds and hardly any TV programing information. You call two hours a day from 8-10 of nightly programs tv information?,1
Is not for Hobbyst,1
Good magazine with interesting info and informative articles.  Only took away one star because it's so small and only 6 times per year.,4
"Time magazine, of course is great (on most topics) however Amazon's price beat dircet price offered by Time magazine.",4
I did not renew my subscription. The writing and topics just weren't that good.,1
my 4th grade girls love this,5
It was a good issue,4
Received 3 issues only sucked,1
"Great magazine, seems a little shorter than the paper copy. Love the recipes and new ideas though! I plan to cook a few of them soon!",4
"Not as good as it once was, mostly ads. I canceled after 1 issue.",3
"Lots of useful, current information, but somewhat rambling. Overall a very good source of information. This magazine appears to be for the very knowledgable gun person.",4
"Really good articles, written by who actually ride motorcycles.
Not a collection of paid articles from bike makers, who wants to advertise their products.",4
I love this magazine. Always interesting.,5
I love reading this mag. They really find new authors and even from different country's .,5
"There are not many actual recipes, mostly ads.  A lot of recipes call for things that can't be found easily or are expensive ingredients.",2
I can't believe you actually want me to review the magazine you pushed to my Kindle without my knowledge or consent!.,1
One of my most favorite magazines.  Always interesting and current.,5
Love my magazine every month,5
"The articles are very good, once you wade through page upon page of advertising. Which begs the question: With ALL of the advertising, why is this magazine so expensive?",4
"If you want a magazine full of ads go ahead, otherwise don't waste your money.",1
love my magazine,5

Incredible price to make my wife happy every month. Have subscribed for many years.,5

Their app has been multiple charging our accounts. And then it is difficult to get a refund. Must fix it this century - right?,1

Expensive for a cooking magazine,1
I have orderd this but have not received any issues yet - how do you rate something they have not sent you?  It must be 6+ weeks since ordered,1
Veranda is a great value and a great quality magazine. Subscription through Amazon is fast and easy.  I recommend it if you take pride in your home and your garden.,5

My grandaughter outgrew the magazine.  We are going to cancel it.,1
After a recent article promoting gun control by Dick Metcalf I have canceled my subscription. They have really let us down. I feel so betrayed words cannot describe it.,1

Great to be able to read this on my Kindle.  I am so happy.  I wish more or all magazines did this.,5
The content is often quite good. But the use of dark colored papers makes it difficult to read.,3
Ok magazine. It has lots of information regarding new bikes. Not much regarding older bikes or mechanics.,3
"Best film review magazine. Film reviews of old, classic, and new films.",5
My mom just received her first issue. A Christmas issue in January. That shouldn't count as an issue in my opinion of its old. Just my two cents.,3
Very practical information and do not have to be a member of weight watchers to enjoy the benefits of the information in this magazine,4

"Best mag, digitally and for real.  Dolan's guest editing was fantastic and matched the movie!",5
I bought this for my almost 3 year old and it's a bit too big for him. Will keep for the future. Love the vivid pictures.,5

The 14-day free trial seemed so easy until I realized that unsubscribing is a secret not told on the Kindle.  Am I doomed to receive this abreviated Newsweek forever?,1

"This magazine is an excellent sampling of Southern delights, whether it be art, food, music, fashion... they have it covered.",5

I have enjoyed this magazine for years. I renew every year for 17 years now.,5

For my mom and she loves it,5
"Not accurate, some shows play at times not listed.  Far too much advertising and B.S.

My favorite magazine.  Love it. Chock full of great ideas and information,5
I was not fond of the format and articles were too brief for me.  I don't know if I would renew the subscription.,3

Haven't received my subscription yet! I going to give this product more time  to arrive to my home before  I contact who is responsible.,1
Best price ever.,5
magazines may have gone digital but that makes their ads even more annoying--it takes way too long to get to the stories and by then I don't want to read it.,1
Too many advertisements. Felt like it was a waste of money. My child was easily bored with this magazine.,1
A great App!  I love the magazine and love the convenience of having it on my Kindle.  Thanks Essence,5
Hope you want your daughter to do drugs and start being sexually  active at a young age. This magazine has inappropriate articles and is terrible for young girls.,1

No photos. Why would you want National Geographic without pictures.,1
"I bought this magazine while waiting at the airport hopefully to learn something.  Disappointed, I found too many ads in the magazine while information is so-so.",2
Too many ads and not enough product content,2
Very happy to be receiving this directly to my home. I love the magazine and having it delivered is so convenient.,5

nels. I really enjoy this magazine and hope to be able to continue to purchase it. This book has interesting information if you want to learn about spiritual and physical health.,4
Love this....very informative!,5
Just not as good since they switched to single-themed issues. Liked it much better before,3
It is certainly not the Women's Day that we purchase in the shops was not impressed just pages and pages of advertisements no stories,1
Just a bunch of marketing trying to get you to purchase a bunch of toys. Articles are too short and it should have more on fitness.,2
I bought this as a gift subscription for my daughter-in-law.  She loves it!  I'd get a subscription for myself if they published a vegetarian version.,5
Overpriced these days for a thin magazine .Few articles of interest IMHO to the average owner..,1
Unfortunately I didn't like the contents of the magazine . Pretty boring I got my first one yesterday and it's already in the trash ;-(,1

"This magazine makes a great gift for friends and family.  They will be sure to love it.  If you are a perfectionist, I would recommend Cook's Illustrated magazine... it's awesome!",5
"Excellent! I look forward to every issue. I had no idea just how much I didn't know.  The letters from the subscribers are educational, too.",5
The recipes require so many ingredients and they're not what the average person would eat.,3
"I couldn't believe Amazon sold Readers Digest! And ""The Price Was Right""!!!
Thank You for all your wonderful assortment of merchandise!",5
Good magazine for contemporary articles.  The poetry is pretty bad.  The comics are very funny.,4
"Had a lot of delivery problems, I will not renew again",2
"I love the magazine, but wish it wasn't auto renewal",4
My husband is a long time subscriber/reader - quality varies from month to month - reduced the number of issues recently - maybe it is 10/year.,4
This gossip rag is such a fun guilty pleasure to thumb through while on the treadmill.,4
My son had never received any issues of this magazine. Very disappointing.,1
Great magazine.  Provides a lot of great tips and tricks and reviews of tools and power tools. and lawn care power tools,4
"it is not as useful as I would like.  Most of the reviews are for products, services, stores, etc. only on the East Coast.",3
Best everr!,5
"Well, perhaps the The Economist audience was the wrong population of reader upon which to attempt extortion?",1
"This magazine ain't what it used to be, unfortunately.",3
"I never received anything and now can't find a way to call anyone.....
My credit card was charged immediately and 2 months latter still no magazine, rip off",1
Their business isn't cooking but rather taking advantage of laws allowing them to charge for nothing. Their management model is excrement.,1
I ordered this for my son. However both he and I are receiving the magazine. I don't golf. Waste of magazine.,1
This is really stupid. I can buy Time for Kindle for $2.99 a issue or subscribe for $1.99 a copy. Who is the idiot who decided that? This world is full of stupid people.,1
didn't receive all issue that I paid for it,1
Great magazine for children of all ages! I read it with my Grandaughter!,5
Magazine has gone off the rails.,1
"I enjoyed this magazine, but did not really love it and as it got higher in price my interest declined to the point where I lost inenrest completely and no longer subscribe.",3
Best Gardening Magazine!,5
"It's only $179 a year on the website, this is a complete rip off.",1
Too much advertisement.  The articles are good however would like more articles and less advertsing. Received two issues not a year's worth.,3
I've been an INC subscriber for years and the magazine has lots of valuable info for startup businesses. But it has become too politicized lately.,4
I love this magazine...it's one of my favorites. The stories and articles are relevant to today's society and each month I look forward to it arriving in my mail.,5
There is not any guide for daytime television and the evening guide does not cover every channel.,1
Colorful articles with clear instructions for above average do it yourselfers.,4
"Love this magazine with its updates on subjects covered: IT, 3d printers, hacking, etc",5
This rag sucks!,1
i don't know how to use the one for oneline yet and i like the one that comes in the mail,3
"VERY GOOD RECIPES, AND EASY TO FOLLOW",4
I did not need a renewal and do not appreciate your doing so.,1
Do Not Buy,1
"Poor writing, and includes a ridiculous full-page ad for male sexual enhancements.  Don't give this to kids.",1
. Lots of gossip and pics which is good. My daughter's only gripe is that the posters are so small. She has been getting it for about 2 years now.,4
too many advertisements. It was hard to find an article to read.,3
I hve not recieved a single issue of the magazine yet. I would like to get the magazine or havey money refunded.,1
Good magazine but overpriced for the amount of stories they developed. Purchased at Amazon my favorite store with gift card.,4
"Stuffed full of adds, this mag occasionally has some helpful articles and reviews, but I doubt there are any that couldn't be found for free on the net.",3
Love the magazine for its insight into the nuts and bolts of the rural lifestyle.  I expect to renew the subscription.,5
$6 for nothing!!! At least people give u the digital and paper magazine with us you never get new issues,1
Oprah is so wonderful and I will always be enthusiastic getting her mag in the mail.,5
"3 stars for price.  The content is excellent, but you don't need it.  Buy only if you are featured in it =-)",4
I will subscribe to this magazine as long as I'm alive! It's a MUST read!,5
"The only reason I subscribed to this magazine is because of all the coupons that it contains. Some of the articles look pretty good, too, but I'm too busy to read them. :P",4
"Really like the articles, and product reviews.",4
I have subscribed to this magazine for several years now and it is always a good read.  Lots of great features and quite a good price.,5
Used to be a great magazine. Now it sucks. All taken over by ads. Come on!,1
Did not download onto my kindle. Was very disappointed,1
Renewal wanted twice the price from last year so I cancelled.,1
The schedule is wrong as often as it is right. Total waste of money,1
Nothing more than Maxim Magazine these days. I wish I had tried Details instead.,1
This by far my favorite magazine!,5
Best ski magazine out there.,5
This use to be a better magazine when it was a complication,2
The magazine is not what I expected.  I do not want to renew it.,2
It was a great deal!,5
I have yet to receive this magazine.  Others ordered at the same time have been received.  What's up?,1
Hard to rate this subscription cause I Have not received anything yet.  No magazine or even a account number so I can view it on my tablet.,1
"I diidn't enjoy  this at all. There were way too many ads, and  it was difficult finding anything. I  can't recommend  this",3
Just received my January issue and it seems to have a lot less pages than it did before.  It was only $5 for the year but won't be renewing it when the year is up.,3
One of my favorite magazines I've purchased for the last thirty five years.,5
It is very sad that The New Yorker is not available for European-based Kindle owners. Please make this available worldwide.,1
I ordered this as a gift for a friend and he loves that his order is very discrete and comes to his mail box around the same time each month.,5
Far more ads than they used to have. Wish there had been more actual content,3
",Should be nil.",3
The recipes are fake and the food made my son sick,1
I have not yet started to receive the magazine.  Should I be?  What's the problem?,1
too complicated!!!! I am going to discontinue it.,1
I've never looked at the magazine myself....All I can say is my niece loves this magazine.  I think it is her favorite!,5
Never got the digital version,1
"Always a favorite! No crazy to find, obscure ingredients. I look forward every month to base our menu on their latest ideas!!",5
Love aviation history and I love this magazine!!,5
Outstanding magazine that has been around for a long time.  Highly recommended reading.,5
Absolutely LOVE this magazine!!!!!!!!!!,5
The title is misleading. This magazine is all about fitness and dieting. There is very lillittle  little here,1
"It's good. Not awesome, but it's good.",3
my daughter enjoyed it,4
"a gift for my daughter,  She said the recipes look great and will try them in the near future. Thaks",4
Not sure if I will reorder,3
Love this deal! Got this as a christmas gift for my in- laws. They loved it!,5
One of my favorite magazines. None of their issues disappoint.,5
"I'm getting the issue of March 2017 instead of 2018, please fix it",1
Worthless Fake 'Time' magazine..!!!,1
Do not know why anybody would buy it here. Bloomberg web site directly sells it to you for 19.99/year or 29.99/two years.,1
Years ago I subscribed to National Geographic and I loved it then and I still love it now. I'm so happy to have it back.,5
"This magazine is for everyone not just for teenagers. Great tips in beauty and fashion. Not to mention, the price is awesome for a year of subscription. Keep it up!",5
good price but got duplicate issues.,3
could not get this to downlosd,1
"Ordered this product at the end of April and the site says it has shipped. Its been a month since, and yet no magazine. This is ridiculous.",1
Love this magazine. Great decorative products and great design work.,5
I can't review what I don't have.  I don't know why but I was informed the subscription will not begin until between Sept. 8 and Oct. 6.  Seems like a long wait to me.,1
By far the best photographic magazine on the planet...  a must have for any world traveler or photo junkie.  A beautiful magazine.,5
I had bought this magazine on the news stand in the past and was pleased to find that I could subscribe through Amazon. One of my favorite magazines!,5
Have not read Countryside for years and so glad to start it up again. Great particles to read. Love to see how others manage to live their dream.,5
Mostly adds hardly any good content,3
Magazine is nothing but advertisements,1
"Gun Dog is a good, but not great, magazine.  Customer support is very poor.",3
Not available  for purchase? Why list it under Kindle Unlimited  then?,1
i advice it because it is interesting to me snd my friends. Articles are too scientific sometime. thank you! i am from ukraine,4
Why would it take 4 months to begin receiving a magazine?  I purchased the subscriptions in August and the estimated delivery is late December.  Why bother?,1
"Really has gone down hill!,, I finally canceled my subscription after they starting writing articles based on their political affiliation!!",1
you can not cancel the subscription. The cancel status is always UNKNOWN.,1
Educational and fun.  Awesome magazine.  So glad to have found it for my Kindle.  Now ill never miss another issue!,5
Decent magazine at a great price.,4
love this magazine.  great for anyone that likes the outdoors.,5
Didn't sign up for auto-renewal and don't want it! Please make it stop! The magazine is a waste of money? OK! I'll repeat do not spend your money,1
"I've always loved reading this publication.  I'd call it inspiring and encouraging; so many stories filled with excitement, and sometimes tears.  Read this one.",5
Larger than library edition which my grandkids did not like and fewer pages will not resubscrib,1
I was very disappointed in the magazine and would like to cancel my subscription.,1
"4 Issues is a bit of a stretch. I've gotten 2, Spring 2015 issue was cancelled, who knows about a Summer 2015 issue. I've received more renewal notices than issues.",1
Esquire has lost some of it's standards over the years.  I feel it has lost some of it quality with very few interesting articles.,3
"Very enjoyable magazine for a man but of course large part is dedicated to the ladies, understandable.",4
"Boring, repetitive themes. Would probably notbuy again",1
Mostly adds not much reading,3
Decent magazine but recipes aren't very healthy or easy.,3
"I don't like they renewed my subscription without telling me. When I tried to cancel it, they told me I was too late.",1
"95% of the magazine are ads!! I bought this subscription for $5 but still wasn't worth it, decided to cancel after first month.",2
Not a great situation with the Kindle,3
I ordered a subscription for my husbands birthday.  The first issue arrived perfectly ontime and he was thrilled with the gift.,5
Love this magazine and this made it so easy to renew.,5
Not same quality in recent years in my opinion; regular subscriber since 1971.,2
Vain Hair? Really? I'm unsubscribing.,1
This has always been my favorite magazine and to get a whole year of it for just a few bucks was the best deal anywhere.,5
"I don't see why it wouldn't be, since it is available for all the other Kindles.  I'm sorry, but an app doesn't cut it.  I want it in my newsstand, please.",1
Paid too much for Guide. Others have lower prices for the same subscription.  Should have does additional shopping.  Guide is as advertised.,3
"This was cancelled . I would have liked to have gotten it , but the order was messed up",1
By the time it arrives to your house all the articles are dated and all the anime has come and gone. Takes too long to receive.,2
I would like to write a review but the product has not shown up on my kindle. Where did you send it?,1
I only received 3 (THREE) copies of my subscription. I fill ripped oft!,1
I had not realized the format was uneditted write-ins.  I would have preferred articles by professionals.,1
Liked the magazine very much.  Decided to get a subscription!,4
They need more articles and pictures. Nice magazine. Good add more substance,3
i only received 2 magazines all year!!!!!,1
If I wanted to see Ads while viewing I would watch an infomercial. What happened to quality information? I think I will start venturing to other health mags.,1
"Charisma provides Inspiring and sometimes challenging content, issue after issue. This is my can't miss magazine and I'm sure to read every issue.",4
"I just found it too expensive. The quality of the articles is mediocre, and there is a focus on qualitative rather than quantitative articles.",2
I just love this mag,5
"Absolutely a great magazine. Excellent for all level of cooks.  Incredible variety, and every single thing I've made from this book came out delicious.",5
Interesting magazine need more reviews,3
One of the best magazines so exciting each month,5
It's not a magazine for a beginner.,1
Excellent magazine. We love getting a copy each month.,5
It did not come with a clutch as stated.,1
This magazine is for those that are interested in runway and high-end salons...it didn't do much for me.,3
Too many ads,2
Says over 2 dozen patters per issue but the first issue I got has 16 and the format is terrible as that page only fills 2/3 of the screen. Patterns are mostly nice.,3
"I have yet to see a copy of the magazine or any confirmation that a renewal has been made, so the jury is still out on this.  So far, not impressed.",1
Way too liberal for me.,1
"I've been reading GOLF Magazine for years and feel it is the best golf magazine available.  I have just begun reading it electronically, which makes more sense for me.",5
Content is not so exciting,2
"No good. I subscribed to this in October, received one copy, and am now told it is unavailable.",1
On time.  Perfect,5
"Mostly agood purchase guide, but I guess not one builds much these days unless they are experts. The hobby used to be mostly builders.",3
If you believe in global warming and other liberal views---this magazine is for you.,1
too much advertising,2
Love it. Just as I remember.,5
TV Guide is only available in Kindle Fire.  It would be nice if I could get it on my Kindle 3.  What a shame.,1
I like Ok Magazine.  It is easy to read since I get it online.,3
"The magazine was fine, but the format made the type too small to read. I do not want to continue my subscription.",3
Totally disappointed. Want to cancel subscription. Only lists evening shows. Total rip off.  Not at all what I would expect from TV Guide.,1
Terrible deal. Cannot access on my Kindle. Truly false advertising. And absolutely ZERO customer support. Glad it only cost me $5.00!!!,1
I love the video clips that come with the Kindle edition.  It puts a new spin on one of my favorite magazines.,5
Just ads with some yoga thrown in. Even at the discounted price I had to cancel. There's no reason to pay for a magazine full of ads.,1
"Love, love, love Atomic Ranch.  Great articles on the mid-century lifestyle and furniture and design.  Look forward to every issue and read cover to cover when it arrives.",5
"I have to cancel this version and switch to the large print as a gift and for myself, love it though.",3
Boring read not interested in majority of articles,1
New Beauty mostly advertisement needs more research information.,3
Not satisfied!!!! Didn't recieve s***. I got scammed. Smfh,1
"Ordered this is May for my son, but he hasn't recieved any of the magazines yet

slow shipping time",1
What a fantastic offer from Amazon.  I will now always look at Amazon first to order my magazines!,5
Magazine has gone to political. Love the financial & yravelmadvise though!,3
"They don't have a listing for during the day, which is when I normally watch TV.  Disappointed, so I won't be renewing my subscription.",2
i needed it,1
This is the BEST photo magazine ever published.  You have to subscribe to it.,5
whats in this book I already know. Not helpful at all. Wont recommend it to anyone its hard to say anthing else no good!!!,1
"I like the special Halloween and Christmas issues, but the other regular issues are rather dull to me.  I rarely find a pattern I want to make in the regular issues.",3
Auto renewal is a hidden charge! Would not purchase this product again!,1
This magazine is always so beautiful. I'm always inspired by every page to apply these ideas to my decor and personal collections.,5
"so many mags are reduced in price, my mom likes this one and we got it for her for mother's day.  we hope she likes it, it is a good read.",4
Even though this item promises to renew your current subscription you will still be charged by ESPN. I'm still trying to get my money back.,1
not what it used to be.  even the paper is poor quality.,2
No comment other than great mag.,3
"Sick adverts Pop Mechanics. Literally almost every other page has an ad on it, mostly about cars or tobacco related paraphernalia. 1/10, would not read again",1
Every month I read most of the articles in this magazine.  It is an outstanding source for what is important in Texas.,5
A lot of ads.  Years ago I enjoyed this magazine.  It is not the same.,2
"For the layman that is a lover all things dinosaur, ""Prehistoric Times"", is ""The Best""!!!",5
"Some of the articles are pretty silly, and a lot of them do not apply to my location (Alaska), but this is magazine is put together well and has some interesting ideas.",3
I received the August issue when clearly the image is for September.  Why would I order August issue on the last day of the month?,1
second best car magazine on the US market after Road&Track but still miles behind Car and Top Gear of UK.  Much cheaper too!,5
Wasn't able to keep interested. Too many ad's,2
"Mostly it appears to be just a long advertising brochure .  Would appreciate more ""how to"" or ""did"" articles without an underlying ad theme.",2
"I was trying to access my digital account because I already receive the magazine by mail, instead I was charged for this book.",1
"Time has been a part of our family for 40 years and will continue to do so.
I like the format and dependable world news coverage.",4
There is nothing new here.  Just reprinting recipes that are already on the website.,2
Too many ads and products reviewed are for the products advertised primarily. Number of pages has decreased by almost half.,2
The Amazon price was the best I could find for 2 years of readersdigest. The first issue has already been delivered & we are totally happy. Thanks Amazon.,5
Fun reading but only shows prime time schedules would like better if it had a full days schedule.  Great price.,4
"Don't bother with the digital, it does not exist. I spent hours talking to the yahoos at Amazon trying to get it activated, and all they did
for me was waste my time.",1
To Left of Right,1
I prefer the magazine this way it is terrible! You cannot see the pages great and I do not like it!,1
"I think the title says it all.

I renew using Amazon... no magazine yet.",1
Too much advertising,3
Wine coverage is very weak.,2
"One of my favorites. A must have in any shooters bathroom collection!

The service great, and the process simple.
A+",5
"It was ok, not that great.",3
Clearly not a mag for middle income people.  Even the recipes have ingredients that your local grocery store is not likely to carry.,1
Reader's Digest has always a good magazine with relevant material.  It still is today and the Kindle version is just as good.  Very clean design.,4
what in the world happened to Maxim????? If I knew it had changed so drastically I would have never bought it. Do Not Buy!!!!!,1
I like these mags because I like to be current with the newest games coming out. It's not the best mag but it's pretty good.,4
I love People Magazine because it always publishes everything that is important and all that I want to read about. I look forward to receiving it every week.,5
"Been reading for 45 years love it,",5
Ads run cover to cover and each year fewer in depth articles. Still there isn't many other options out there and this one does contain a gem or two each issue.,3
good reporting,4
Cancelled subscription a year early.  This publication has become a crappy magazine nowadays.,1
is was very thin and not very many recipes.,2
Still haven't received it!  Would love to review it but all I can say is... Never got it!  How long does it take?  It has been almost two months now.,1
Never got all access. Only the print copies,1
I was never granted access,1
A lot of ads.  Decent articles and exercise ideas.,3
This is by far 1 of my favorite magazines.  I usually read it front to back and an added treat is all the coupons that are in every issue.,5
a decent firearms magazine.,3
super fun for my 10 yr old son who loves Reptiles.,5
I didn't like any of the projects.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Must have very large area to use most ideas. Just didn't appeal to me at all,1
Could do with waaaaaaay more articles and less ads,1
"A lot of advertising.

Expensive interiors.

Not relatable to most.",2
"Too many ads, but for $5. a year, can't complain too much.  Probably won't renew, though.",3
"I have two fashionistas, ages 9 and 7. We LOVE this magazine.  As a mom, I am very thankful for the great content that is AD FREE!  You will not regret your subscription!",5
Great information for all runners. Love the magazine. The monthly exercise tips and races at the back of the magazine are great!,5
Awesome! I get to see the magazine before the hardcopy comes in the mail.,5
Great recipes.,4
"got one magazine, never the rest of the year",1
Very disappointed!!!!!  I really wanted the October 2015 issue.  That never happened.  Will definitely not reorder!!!!!!,1
"I love this magazine!

I enjoyed the ease of ordering and the availability of tracking my subscription online.  The price was great.",5
My 2nd grader loves reading these magazines!,5
Ugh. Seriously every issue is the same stuff. Never thought I would get bored of sex,1
I can't wait to get this almost every month.  It's colorful and full of wonderful ideas even if you don't live close to the beach.,5
what a terrible magazine.,1
One the best military history magazines on the market. Always well written with articles from diverse and well balanced historical periods. Highly recommended.,5
I have bought many magazines from Amazon.com and have been very pleased with magazines and also How fast you receive them.,5
I like the articles regarding the upcoming show.,4
"This is the only magazine I subscribe to. Great articles, great fashion and make up tips. It's fantastic tat I can view it on my kindle.",5
"this mag totally bores me. i mean, i like lyric poetry somewhat but when will POETRY start representing concrete and spatial poetics every now and then?",3
This is my favorite magazine.  My subscription lapsed so I thought I'd renew via Amazon so I can keep better track of it.,5
I ordered this for my son. He loves reading MAD Magazine. It is the closest he has ever been to a comic book.,5
Do not want to renew don't read that much called to cancel guess you didnot get the message don't want to renew Southern Living,1
I've been a subscriber for decades.  Always a great read!,5
"Just what I was looking for.  Small farming, how to pick and choose...everything, inspiring farming articles. I love the photography and information. Awesome!",5
"I loved this magazine. The only thing is, I only got one issue! I was very disappointed in this terrible service. Will not buy again",1
My favorite SF magazine which I usually cannot find at the newsstand so a subscription is the solution to access,4
"Got this for my Dad for Christmas. Little expensive, but he loves it. Good articles and information for DIY types.",4
Will not renew. Prefer the print edition. Cannot find what I'm looking for. If you don't like ads then this is for you.,1
I can't give my personal opinion.  It was a gift to my granddaughter.  I think she likes it.  I have given it to her before.,3
"Abysmally designed, poorly presented, totally confusinguser-unfriendly. A total waste of my money.",1
No for me to much junk I don't care for,1
My son enjoys reading about WWII history.,4
Fantastic magazine and a favorite!,5
I never received a copy of this magazine i am still waiting on my first issue.,1
I buy this every year for my mother and she absolutely LOVES it.  She keeps every issue so she can look back through them often.,5
Way to much adds. But I like the information.,3
Love the TV Guide.  Can't beat the price.,5
"Good magazine, plenty of recipes and good ideas.",4
My daughter was very glad to get this!,5
Magazine has come on time every month and I received the gift a short time after ordering my subscription.,4
"I have still not recieved my subscription yet you ask for a review of the product
? Isn't this a poor business practice",1
"A good magazine, easy to read and some good recipes. Not sure if I will resubmit another year. Not sure if it is worth the price for what you get.",3
"I've always loved ""Country"" magazine because it reminds me of my childhood. From the animals and the flowers to how to grow a good tomato.",5
Bought this subscription for my husband.  Makes a great gift for the man in your life and is by far one of his favorite publications!,5
Cant complain. Its decent.,3
Plenty of easy recipes,4
"Works fine on my Kindle Fire. Easy reading, good visuals. Way too many ads in my opinion, but a decent app otherwise.",4
Any magazine that lets a blatant racist like Donald Trump on their cover doesn't deserve any subscriptions. Make America Smart Again.,1
This magazine is the best for innovators and entrepreneurs all over the world. I highly recommend it for anyone which has or wants to start a business.,5
Not gong to subscribe to any magazines any longer they are all the same.,1
"best ever mag,",5
"Somewhat disappointed, this magazine is for 8 and up and my 7 1/2 yr old is not that interested in the topics covered.",2
"ite's popular mechanics, just what I expecterd",4
"Interesting but many many ads to flip past, not enough content.",3
Not as convenient as a paper magazine - barely look at it,1
I can learn how to eat healthy and do exercise at the gym on my own thank you very much.  I cancelled my subscription.,2
Readers Digest is one of my favorite magazines.,5
good book,4
Not as informative as I expected,2
"Does not allow text only views on the Android, so it its very cumbersome to read the extremely small print.",2
"love these mags, they stimulate the mind.",5
I would not recommend this magazine too many ads and products they are too expensive.,1
"This one is the only one i would even consider renewing out of three i was getting. i liked it, i just don't need it. I would consider ordering it again later.",3
Not enough stories to many advertisements,2
Great info  the only difficulty is the guide for shows itself is difficult to navigate. But I read it for everything besides the tv listings,4
"Have always loved this magazine...always learn something, and look forward to every issue.",5
Love the magazine but hate the web site.,4
A GREAT MAGAZINE AND A GOOD PRICE AT AMAZON.  I HAVE BEEN A SUBSCRIBER FOR AT LEAST 4O0 YEARS!,5
"All ads, very little content. I would say about 85% of it is advertising. Was also supposed to receive a clutch, but that never came through.",2
"I always look forward to each issue, there seems to be something I want to try each magazine. I've been a subscriber for 20+ years! Call it an addiction.",4
I've been subscribing to Vanity Fair for about 25 years.  It is the best magazine that there is.,5
The magazine itself was a good read. I now have a very expired magazine I can't get rid of.,4
I got this for my mom and she loves it.,5
Have found some recipes I might try and a fun read.,4
Great articles. I have only received 2 issues but both have had several valuable articles that I enjoyed reading. I look forward to the next issue.,4
very hard to use since they discontinued the app last year. was great now it pretty useless.,1
Bought it for my 12 year old granddaughter... she's not thrilled.,3
How can I rate this magazine if I have not receive it yet nor on my kindle as it states (print + Kindle),1
Worth getting.  Look forward each month for its arrival.  Learn new things about natural ways of feeling better every issue.,4
Another great magazine for wife.,4
Beautiful magazine!  Excellent articles and lovely pictures.  I really enjoyed reading about the Bronte sisters' home in the last issue.,5
it is so much smaller than I expected but the kids will like it I hope.,4
"Not much new content and rehashes the old material under new titles, just read online sites and you will be informed",1
Wasn't what I expected.  I receive this publication for free at my local independent bookstore. I plan on unsubscribing as soon as I can.,1
As always a pleasure to read.,4
"I will be canceling my new subscription this was not what I was hoping it would be, thankfully I am still within the 30 day trial",1
I only received the tote.,1
"We have subscribed to National Geographics for Kids for four years now. This is one of the best kid magazines I have seen. It has great stories, games and puzzles.",5
"I received the ""tote"" bag but no magazine.  Seems weird to me as normally I get the magazine but not the free gift......",1
"It's all ads. There is barely anything to actually read :(. This is all about marketing not education and growth.
Disappointing",1
i enjoyed this publication for years,4
This book contains tooooo much ads. even the ads. is more than the articles. I really do not like this. I think is must why it is that cheap.,2
"Oprah, what can I say.  Nothing is as laughable as someone who believes they are way smarter than they are.  Lots of advertising, very little usable content.",1
One of my favorite magazines.  I always sit down within an hour of delivery to view the images and read the articles,5
"This is a wonderful magazine, enjoy every page, worth re-reading several times.  The pictures are beautiful.  Never gets old. A magazine to share with friends.",5
Not sure as I have yet to receive a copy.  It is very hard to fairly judge a magazine or anything for that matter when not one magazine has arrived.,1
My only complaint is this magazine keeps getting smaller and smaller.,4
It's all advertising with a few factoids about some coins.,2
can't  wait to get my new magazine  every week!!!,5
"I love this magazine. Lots of ride articles, reviews, and tips. I would say it is geared toward the adventure/touring rider. I read every issue from cover to cover.",5
enjoying it,3
"The American Scholar is the magazine I've always wanted. Superb essays, superb poetry. My thanks to Anne Fadiman.",5
"Order...and the sub starts in a few weeks.  A great gift that arrives
every week.",5
This is the best cooking magazine out there.,5
Awesome magazines. Just took forever to start receiving.,5
"I get this magazine for the great information it has for my life.  It is extremely reasonably priced, just cant beat it.  One of the best!",5
I've only received a couple issues but I've enjoyed reading it although I haven't gleaned any valuable information that is useful so far.,4
every thing is fine  but who cares  16words?  please cancel my order  how about  please cancel mY order  cancel my order  i made the 16 word  DO YOU GET IT,1
"Lots of ads, but still a fun read when I want a break.",4
Excellent product very happy with purchase...,5
Magazine is everything you expect. Disappointed with the wait time. It took 4 months to receive the first issue!,1
A tad too fancy for me. Some good ideas in high budgets,3
Good reading - uplifting stories,4
"The content IS advertising! The whole magazine is nothing but promotion of products, and they should pay ME to read it.",1
Love this magazine  I love getting recipes that are easy,5
"Better than most of the other women's fitness magazines, has more useful information and is less driven by advertisements in general",4
"good ATV mag, not too frequent issues",4
This is my favorite magazine. Ive been subscribing for over 10 years. Always relevant and helpful articles.,5
Excellent magazine for artists.,5
"I love Inc and Entrepreneur, and getting the print and electronic version is fantastic! I plan to keep the subscription active for a long time.",5
More ads than articles. You pay only five bucks for this because the advertisers cover the other $15 a subscription would normally cost.,2
Love this magazine.  Has great recipes and interesting articles.  This and VegNews are my favorite magazines.,5
"The magazine is on the device but to open it, I wait for page downloads that sometimes never happen. Other publications work fine",1
I don't like the style,2
Always on point with the latest trends. I look forward to every issue!,5
Not as easy to navigate as the real magazine.,3
cancelled subscription,1
The format makes it hard to read. I had not read for several years and the articles are not as informative as in years past.,3
"love, love, love this subscription!  usually, i tear out just a few recipes in cooking magazines.  not this one!  every page is full of great tips and recipes.",5
Doesn't allow reading from different panes (both vertical and horizontal views). One is restricted to only vertical reading.,1
I enjoyed the magazine but prefer Mother Earth News...I am not quite as self reliant as other readers and they might enjoy Self Reliance more than I did.,3
"I have been a subscriber for several years. I'm totally disappointed in your issue, you are replacing content with advertising. I pay for the magazine not to view advertising.",1
So months better than others.  Wish it had more celeb beauty content!,3
Got it for one year for $5. Now it's kn auto renew for $25 and I can't figure out how to turn it off. May have to call them...,1
"Informative, easy reading and practical",4
Has good stories in it. Needs more recipes.,4
good price when on sale. Its for my wife.,4
"I can not rate the subscription yet, because I will not get it they say until June 2014. You would think they could get it out a little sooner then almost four months.",1
Best price I could find. Subscription started earlier than stated.,5
This magazine is amazing!  For a small publication this magazine has so many articles and interesting topics they cover.,5
Great deal and the first one came quickly.,5
So far so good as long as delivery keeps on schedule. I have been a shotgun news customer for over 20 years and this was the best deal out there for resubscribers.,5
Not very in depth.,2
digital won't work on kindle fire!!,1
"I read this magazine almost cover to cover each issue. The articles are always fresh and sometimes predict the future of aviation ,cars, and technological advancements",4
I have had Texas Monthly for 3 years now. Almost every issue has multiple great stories. My only complaint is the amount of multiple page ads (travel guides) in it every week.,4
My 14 year old daughter very disappointed. Lots of Sale Ads.,1
Did not wish to renew this subscription!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  delete it....stop the subscription..I like to order personally...like to make my own choices to renew,1
Can't beat a wired magazine for keeping up with all kinds of topics.  Highly recommended for EVERYONE.,5
"I wanted to inform all, I am not getting this magazine, not received a single copy so far. I can only comment if I get the magazine.",1
This is the best resource for writers. Plenty of great ideas and examples and guidelines. I am definately stasified with this subscription,5
Conde Nast editors at Teen Vogue just publsihed an article promoting Anal Sex to Teens... Do you want to support a company that's promoting this stuff?,1
The recipes do not have normal everyday ingredients to make it easy to make.,3
Its alright,3
We have subscribed this magazine for 3yrs and enjoyed every one. Photography and articles make great reading for the whole family.,5
Love this magazine !  Great recipes and tips from top Chefs.  Pictures that look so delicious you  c an't wait to try the recipe !!,5

News I could used.  I just wish I had the time to read it,4
This review is regarding the Economist on Kindle. Great magazine and format but the price on Kindle is too much to stomach.,3

"Only received one magazine so far.  A lot of variation, so I think we will enjoy it.",4
"Do not download, Did not download all the way for me and still was charged very disappointed will not download again",1
Always bought this and women's day at the checkout counter always had good articles in it to read and up to date ads,4
I thought it would be for everyday cooks...not.  I found most of the recipes required out of the ordinary ingredients. Sorry I subscribed.,1
"The articles are always interesting, concise and with many tips that one can learn from.  The format is creative and it's an easy read.  I love it!",5
I have receive my first two issues and I must that it is a good magazine for people who like to be updated about movies and tv. shows. Looking forward for next issues.,4

Disappointed with issue,2
Great ideas! Suggestions and directions for real life!!,4
Great that the digital download is quick. Still have not gotten the magazine or the tote and it's been a couple months.,4
It's a magazine....it's ok....I bought it for reference because it was recommended to me by someone else.  Not my style though.,3
My husband loves this magazine. Perfect present for the handyman in him.,5
I ordered this subscription and never received even one issue. I don't even understand how it's possible that they could charge my Dad's card for it.,1
Too much advertisement but overall a pretty good magazine would not pay full price for this magazine.,3
"I don't like the contents, very poorly put together compared to many other magazines.",1
"I cannot read this magazine with all of the ads. Every other page is an ad. You get half of the magazine, maybe. Some pages have ads on both sides. Go for HGTV Magazine instead.",1
It was ok but didn't like the recipies enough to keep subsription.,3
A perfect example of no science and to much politics.  Just another rag for the climate change crazies.  Don't buy it.,1
"more designed for purchased things, not created things.",2
A favorite but don't use it on my Ipad.,4
"I purchased this as a fundraiser...didn't realize it was a ""digital"" edition.  I don't care for it at all.  down $ 20",1
The print is way too small and unable to be enlarged to an acceptable size.  I should have listened to the other comments regarding this.,1
I love Southern Living magazine.  You can't beat the price through Amazon.  Being from the south it is such a joy to look through the recipes and look at the wonderful gardens.,5
horrible waste of money,1
As soon as I ordered this found out they no longer are printing the magazine.,1
"Used to love this magazine, now its more advertisements then anything else.",1

Liberal trash! Cancelled my subscription,1
We renew this for him every year for Christmas.  He enjoys it and loves to dabble in the stock market.,5
"It's somewhat repetitive, so I did not renew.",3
You Can't Rely On The Information In It .And I Had To Go Through 68 Pages Before I Got To The Schedule The Schedule Only Covers 8-11PM Events.,2
This magazine was enjoyable from the first page until the last.  I highly recommend it.  Articles were written well and gave great information,5
It's ok but not as good as Golf Magazine or Golf Tips.,3
I did not want to buy this it I s not what I like it's not what I look a t,1

Get magazine. Love the old stories.,5
I ordered a 1 year subscription but only got the first 3 issues!! and now they stopped coming.,1
This is definitely a magazine for a younger reader.,4
Nice variety of recipes.,4
NOT ENOJUG READING MATERIAL IM INTERESTED IN,1
This publication is hard to read on my kindle with my vision. It may be fine for someone with 20/20 or better vision. My vision is only correctable to 20/40,1
Ordered it for an 11 year old horse lover and she wasn't really excited about it.,3
This magazine is ENTIRELY adds. Worthless.,1

"The stories, locations, and special interests topics are spectacular and well written.  Would recommend this to all of my friends.",4
"This is the only crossword book that I do, it is just the best.",5
Good amount of stories to advertisements coming from a highly respected woman.,4
Not like it was years ago. Seemed like a mini edition. Didnt find any good recipes I wanted to try.!,3
Why is a hard copy subscription $10/year and the e version 1.50/month.  Seems backwards to me. Shouldn't the e version be less expensive.  No mailing etc.,1
This is the one of the best magazine publications I have ever been enjoying reading and buying.  Subscription gave me price i can read a whole year long.,5
Having this on my fire make storage so easy. Color pages are clear. My only complaint is the paper version is available way before the e version. It's hard to wait to read it !!!,4
"I freaking love this magazine. It's funny, informative, contemporary, and has an excellent mix of recipes, stories, tips, reports, and photos and infographics.",5
"what a fabulous magazine, probably the most impressive publication I receive.  Have
read from cover to cover.  Cant wait for the next issue.",5
I am somewhat disappointed with my first issue. I am a novice and the info is too complicated for me. I thought there would be more photos. This magazine is okay.,3

Waste of money!,1
the best shelter magazine,5
I was subscribed to the magazine for many years and USED to love it.  I hate this kindle edition.  All ads.  Cannot find a place to unsubscribe.  Help !,1
"The articles just aren't as interesting as they used to be.  Why would I care about the 20 best places to live in America?  I can't move there, so it's very boring.",2
Food Network Magazine is one of the best ever! I have been a subscriber for several years and have never been disappointed in any issue. Each issue has something for everyone.,5
I've looked at this magazine intermittently over the last few years and found this issue much thinner than I expected.  Perhaps future issues will have more articles per issue.,3
"Strange  mag, got as a gift, so far it has been pretty boring.",2
Good magazine but a bit pricey,4
I would not order again.  Do not renew.,1
"Waste of money. If you're 25, maybe.",1
It's gone downhill in recent years. Maybe they have run out of content?,3
My granddaughter loves all of these National Geographic Little Kids books!!  I have them all!!  They are so colorful and informative!!  Love Love Love them!!!,5
I got a few good ideas out of this magazine.  I'll probably continue the subscription since it was a fair price.  I would recommend it.,4
"It's Star, what do you expect? Trashy, cheesey, guilty, pleasure. It has pictures and words.  Better than sitting waiting for the doctor with nothing to read.",2
"Great magazine, always beautiful rooms with wonderful ideas, have been getting it for years and it's a treat when it arrives.",5
"thank you. I work for weight watchers, so I love reading her magazine",5
The very first time I saw the beauty of a timber framed home I knew I would someday want to live in one.  The magazine's articles and pictures just keep the dream alive.,4
I was disappointed. One in the magazine Two I tried to cancel order later same day and was told it was to late.,1
I expected much more. Too expensive for a kindle version. Needs so much improvement  . I was advised not to get it. Bad choice,1
"It's nice to get Reader's Digest on my Kindle, but the pictures are too blurry to see. You'd think technology today could do better!",3
Articles are well written and photography is good.,4
Decent magazine that has a few tips but most of the magazine is ads. The reviews are pretty good but nothing you couldn't find at [...],3
Totally a rip off never got a single issue,1
Did not come on a regular basis,1
I subscribe to the magazine but I'm using fire version for the first time and I'm very disappointed with the low quality images.,1
I like it and extended my subscription,4
"Bought this for my niece who loves fashion, she likes it and the clothes, has a lot of ads in it.",4
The best bargain for this type of magazine.  Easy to read with great photos!  A lot of fun reading for a great price!,5
"PEOPLE is three things, human interest stories, celebrity gossip and reviews (don't forget the crossword puzzle) For light news try PEOPLE.",4

I love Guidepost.,5
Books are behind a month. I bought for son but he has already read at friends because of late delivery,3

Its awful,1
My favorite mag! Only place you can read health news without all the girly fluff.,5
Not worth the read.,1
This is one of the best Southern magazines out there. It's a mixture of Oxford American and Southern Living. Not too much fluff and puff pieces. I highly recommend.,5

THIS IS GREAT FOR10-15 YEAR OLD KIDS.THIS MAGAZINE IS AWESOME!!!!!!",5

I love this magazine. Have been receiving it for several years. Enjoy the content and wonderful pictures. It came in handy when planning my trips to Great Britain.,5

I love this magazine!! Perfect for a 9 year old like me!!,5

"Totally waste of money. Full of advertisements... hardly find any nice articles to read, very disappointed with the way they are not.",1
"I gave it four stars only because I'm a vegan, and there aren't many meat free/dairy
free recipes.  However, I do enjoy the tips and the fact that it's chock full of

This magazine should be covered as any other pornographic magazine. Just the title of the articles can give you an idea of the vulgarity in it.,1
Son enjoyed the magazine.,4
Great deal for an exremely informative and helpful magazine.,4
This is one magazine that is so one sided it is un-American.,1
One small sized magazine filled with advertisements.  Avoid.,1
This was a gift for my kids and we got it for their cousin. Fantastic magazine. Great images and beautiful age appropriate poetry.,5

"This magazine is always a ""work of art""....great photography and  superb and interesting articles which are highly educational! LOVE IT!
Helen Kuzmier",5
Too many ads.  I feel like this is nothing but a magazine for marketing.  Seems like over half the pages were ads for realtors or doctors.  Rich wanting to be richer.  Nice!,2
Got a subscription for my girlfriend at the discounted Amazon rate. Had no problems with the subscription. She loves it!,4
My husband thinks this is the best.  He keeps all his old magazines and rereads them over and over.  Thanks,5
So far this is not the magazine of my choice.  Life Extension is a million times more informative.,3
"good magazine, good art, bad parent company.",4
Awesome magazine.  We enjoy it a lot.,5
Horrible magazine filled with nothing but ads! I knew this wasn't going to be a highly intellectual magazine but when my husband even said he didn't like it I knew it was trash.,1
The best writing I've found in a beautifully done quarterly about stringed instruments and the people who love them.,5
If you like out of the ordinary foods this book is for you.,3
It is a quick-look picture book; not much storyline.,3
I did not give the OK to renew automatically!,3
don't like it,1
"I really enjoyed the articles and I plan on trying some of the recipes.

Very nice.

Best regards,
S.Porter",4
"It's always been my favorite to read any time of day/night.....amazing stuff. It's my family treasure, since I grew up in the '50's.",5
This magazine is worth every penney with the great money saving tips and large selection of coupons in it.  It is the best magazine a woman can purchase!,5
A chance to catch up on what's happening back home while stationed in California.,4
This is under my husbands name because he ordered it for me. Compaired to the other mags in this area it falls short.,1
Love the website and the Mag is even better!,5
This was a gift for my daughter who lives in Mass.  She likes it and I plan to renew it for her.,4
I do not want to receive this magazine!,1
"Forbes Magazine. Save your money. It's nothing but advertisement. The magazine comes in the mail, and I take it straight to the recycling bin.",1
A once-great journal has joined the vapid heard & now sells the same shallow narrative as all the rest. May it Rest In Peace.,1
"This is a very informative magazine, but probably more advanced the average player needs or would be able to put into action.",3
American Scientist is much better and deeper. This now seems like it is for 9th graders or something.,3
Lots of ads and content not terribly valuable,3
"very very busy, hard ti find the interesting thing, to much of anything not a single theme to catch interest of a child for longer than a second",2
This magazine is actually enjoyable and has interesting article. I love to decorate.,4
OKAY FOR THE PROMO PRICE.  I WOULD NOT RE SUBSCRIBE,3
When my 10 year old Grandson received his first issue he sat down and went through it non stop.  He is still quoting it.,1
i ordered this product for Xmas and have yet to receive an issue.  Amazon sold but magazine did not deliver.,1

"A useless guide, only between 8pm and 10pm.
Shows only one PBS station, we have three.
Of the 84 pages only 28 devoted to station guiding.",1
It is an interesting magazine..not just fashion and beauty but enjoyable book reviews and informative articles.,4
I love reading this magazine but lately everyone I buy an issue on my kindle it won't load properly.,1
this magazine is  ok but  I don't have a lot of the things needed for the recipes in it,3
"I thought the kindle version of the magazine was too expensive, I would not consider purchasing it again. Many thanks.",3
Kids LOVE IT!!!,5

"Great magazine for technology and science.  Has some silly stuff, but well worth $5. a year.",4
I've been a subscriber for years.  I love this magazine!!!!!,5
Judge judy's divorce and scandal was over 10 yrs ago. Pictures look fake and photoshopped. Not worth a read.,1
So so magazine.  It was a good buy but nowhere near as good as American Art Collector.  You get what you pay for.,3
My 12 year old loves this magazine.  I am very pleased with the content.  It is much more appropriate than a lot of teen magazines available.,5
I love the National Geographic and have loved it since I read my first one at my piano teacher's house in 1948.,5
I already have The New Yorker Print & Digital subscription. Why do I need to pay again for a subscription on my Kindle Voyage?! Completely unacceptable.,1
Not as good as it was years ago.  Plus they make it very hard to cancel.,3

Constantly has to re download. Basically unreadable.,1
ordered both the magazine and the digital.  cannot seem to get the digital on IPAD.,1
"GQ used to have class. I love this magazine.
 Lately, it has become nothing more than a platform to promote the radical socialist agenda of Obama.",5
Great alternative to the paper magazine. Love it.,5
great magazine. interesting ideas. great price,4
i did not order auto renewal....and there was an additional discount offered which i was not given,1
Great paper stock. Nice and glossy. Great that is not a lot of political non sense.,4
"Great content, lousy design. The magazine is often impossible to read. I feel bad for the writers who spend so much time on their stories.",1
To much advertising. Not enough recipes.,2
Articles are short,3
I have never experienced such a horrible kindle magazine.  The type is too small and you cannot zoom. The content looks very interefsting. BUT reading it is frustrating.,1
Interesting but not enough gear mentioned in the magazine! It is a fun read though and worth the money! Hike away!,4
not worth it,1
Too many commercial advertisements and not enough detailed stories,3
Not many recipes.,3
"Initial offer great, then auto renew at twice the price, I cancelled the renewal.",3

It's a good magazine but nothing special.",3

I am disappointed that many of the programs listed in the TV guide are not actually shown as scheduled.,2
"Ridiculous. Show a few recipes and a couple pictures of $25,000 kitchens and you've got this magazine. The rest is nothing but ads for depression and erectile dysfunction.",1
"102 days, (more than 14 weeks) no magazine",1
My wife's favorite magazine.,5

Could not beat the price on this. Very nice magazine.,4

"this subscription was automatically renewed at a higher price, which led me to inspect other subscriptions doing the same...guess i should be thankful??",1
Too many ads vs articles.  Articles are good and encouraging.  Helps you too think before you eat and to plan out your day.,4
Poorly thought out rag,1
"I really don't think any other knitting magazines aside from IK are worth buying. It's beautiful quality with a nice mix of articles and patterns, and really good value for money.",4

Bought this subscription for my daughter with gift certificate and she loves it. Great for all people involved with our horse friends,5

Great magazine for keeping up with all things tech but also exploring how technology helps people deal with their jobs and improve their home lives.,4
"LOVE Reader's Digest, for any age and any gender!",5
It's just an OK magazine.  I would like more articles on treatments for ill pets and on how to keep them healthy.,3
Waste of money. Maybe if you're 25.,1
This is a fun mag because I often get stumped when searching for things about which to write. I like it very much.,4
Popular Science remains one of my top magazines. It keeps me up with a lot of things happening in the tech world.,4
"Be careful, this magazine has misleading information and is basically a front for advertising overpriced and unproven products touted as the cure-all they are not.",1
"I agree with the other review, this is loaded with advertising inserts, and nothing much to read.",3
Very informative with pics and interviews of knife makers and collectors as well! Worth the money! If you like knives you will like this Magazine!!,4
I got this magazine subscription for super cheap and I'm so excited! It comes every month just like it is suppose to and I am really pleased with it.,5
No substance all ads. Cancelled subscription after receiving first magazine,1
I like this magazine. The articles are relevant and its a nice easy read.,4
the app doesnt work 0 stars,1
I never authorized this subscription to be automatically renewed.  Oprah magazine STOLE the price of the renewal from me.  This is a very dishonest business practice.,1
The magazine is mostly advertisements.,2
Great magazine!! So worth the money you spend on the subscription! Best recipes ever and the family loves everything I fix out of Taste of Home,5
"Ordered NY Magazine 5 weeks ago.  Still haven't gotten my first issue.  Tick, tock.",1
Haven't read this in a long time. Love it!,5
STICK WITH THE MAGAZINE.  FINE PRINT ON (SO CALLED CLUB) COST YOU BIG BUCKS.,1
"I've subscribed for nearly 50 years.  It's the greatest.  There's always something to capture my interest, and the photography is still superb.  Every family should have it.",5
wonderful magazine!,5
never buy this product ever.  waste of money.  very bad customer experience.  i will tell all of my friends not to buy this product.,1

She always has great tasting recipes just love paula wish she would come back to tv,4
worst mag i ever sub'ed to. all ad's and stuff i don't care about!,1
too many add.s,3
I tried to order Maxim twice from Amazon and never received it either time.  I will never order a magazine etc. from amazon again!,1
The broad coverage is very good.  There could be more on warm water and salt water species.  The figures are very useful and detailed.,4
Love cars... what's there not to like? Keeps me apprised of the ins and out of the auto world.,5
I bought this for my father.  He loves old/classic cars and he seems to enjoy this magazine.  I think it's a must for classic car junkies!,5
"I have been a fan of Vogue for decades.  The ""Free Clutch"" is a joke.",1
Informative magazine however there are too many advertisements. The price is pretty reasonable. I would recommend this magazine to others.,4

nice magazine,3

I have not received 1 copy yet.  How can I give it anything else?  I will probably enjoy it once that happens.,1
Scam...Shame of Oprah trying to take advantage of people that actually think she cares about any of them.,1
Not enough content to justify price.,2
First issue was good! Looking forward to getting others.,4
Vanity Fair has interesting content if you can find it among the ads.  Amazon subscription services offer a nice discount--just hope it was not a teaser rate.,3
"beautiful mag, great copy. everything I expect of vanity fair. I guess i get an online copy too, but for the price I was happy just to get a few physical magazines",4
Just not the kind of reporting I expected. Search online and you will get better information for less.,2
"when I signed up I expected the subscription to be added to my present subscription, I received to copies today. Please correct subscription",1
Love this magazine. Magazine seems to always have great write-ups. Well worth the price.,5
All four of my daughters ranging in age from 18 to 10 love perusing this magazine. I loved the price on Amazon!!,5
Some good information,4

Only got one magazine,1
Way too much advertising not enough articles,2
"This is my all time favorite magazine.

The kindle edition in non text mode is unusable. It needs a lot of work. I hope they improve it.",3
I don't know why I keep buying except it is a bad habit?,1
My husband was thrilled to receive this as a Christmas gift this year....he loves his 2nd amendment rights ;),5
This publication provides tremendously valuable insight and it explains everything with nice small words perfectly alligned for easy reading. I love it!,5
Nice magazine with plenty of D.I.Y. articles.,4
"No pictures (some present), awkward table of content.  In all, very unpleasant to read in Kindle format.",1
Much too expensive. If the price does not come down during the two week trial Iwill just cancel.,2
"It's a magazine subscription, what's to say, it shows up on time, and every month, if you like it you do.",4
Horrible. None of the stories are real. Another tabloid rag mag. Won't be renewing. Good thing I only paid 5 bucks.... That's all it's worth for a year.,1

Too many adds and not enough recipes. Photographs of food are beautiful.,2
Love it! The price was excellent.,5
Didn't care for this magazine. Just felt like it didn't have alot of good articles in it,2
"If you like a little more detail and number crunching comparisons of different cars in the same class,  than R &T is a good car magazine to utilize as referencing the differences.",4
Okay but does have damage on cover when I get them in mail,3
Why does Foreign Policy not allow my Kindle Paperwhite in the list of available devices? Does that make any sense whatsoever?...,1

This has been my 11 yr. old daughter's FAVORITE magazine for years.  She absolutely loves it!  She learns something new (and cool) from every issue.,5

"I love this magazine. It has always had great articles and insight into the inner workings of new, old and future science.",5
You are better-off getting print and on-line subscription and then access it in your Kindle. The kindle economist is quite skinny.,1
Love this mag and so do the people that come into my work. I see it is often one of the most picked to read.,5
I have been waiting way too long for the delivery of my first paper copy. and the electronic version is difficult to find/ access on a PC.,1
Love this mag--great decorating ideas!!!,5
I got this magazine as a gift and I have to say I don't like it much---it is full of ads and offers no interesting information what so ever.,1
"I chose to order my subscriptions through Amazon so the auto-renewal would mean that I didn't miss an issue. Well, I missed February. Never got my issue and I'm annoyed.",1
Just full of all kinds of info!  Fun and educational ! Love it !,5
Always full of SEASONAL recipe ideas! ME LOVE VT LONG TIME,5
Was a gift for my husband.  He didn't really care for the magazine and did not renew.,3
I love this magazine because it always has so many useful tips.,5
This is a good magazine but I had difficulty viewing it on my tablet.  I need to subscribe to the hard copy.,3
The main problem was the size of the font on most articles is so small it is hard to read. Will not order again,3
Received my first magazine and there was nothing I could use. A bit disappointed but maybe next month.,3
Several years ago I was also receiving this magazine.  It is 1/4 the size it used to be with not many recipes inside.,2
"LOVE IT! I've been reading Cosmo for years and it just gets better! I'm so glad my renewal started with the ""Adele"" issue!",5
Bought it for a first grader. I thought it was going to be at his level of reading but it isn't. He enjoys the pictures and some of the stories read buy his mother.,3
Can't get on android,1
Love this magazine have read it for years,5
"I like the magazine, but hate that the price doubled from last year. If it wasn't for that, it would have received 5 stars.",3
I have never gotten this product so it's hard to know how to rate it.  Wish amazon would send me things in a timely manner.,1
Used to be an outstanding mag...now it has been bought and they have sold out the main strength and beauty of the mag...very sad time for National Geo..will never support again.,1
I like the magazine but have not received the tote yet.,3
I love travel and this magazine gives tips as well as featuring interesting places.,5
Hi! Love this magazine.,5
Superb magazine with beautiful ideas for decorating your home. Application and selection of colors bring out the best in design features.,5
I like this magazine because it has good recipes. I haven't had a chance to try any but expect that I will soon.,4
Spaniard must!,5
The info is good and the issue out earlier than the news stand.,4
It should come every month!  TOP NOTCH!,5
"magazine good, however i never receive the issues even after i called numerous times to change address and inquire into no deliveries",3
Love everything about this mag.,5
Not my interest,2
This is my favorite magazine. The order was timely and the price for auto renewal is terrific!! I will subscribe to more magazines through Amazon now,5
Great Magazine been reading them for over 50 yrs...,5
"Great magazine to catch up on the current news with, but I do miss it in paper-form.",4
Love!  Great price!,5
"I don't recommend! I ordered on 30 June, as of 31 July I have not received a single copy",1
great Olympics coverage,5
Sorry...not happy with with People Magazine...too liberal for me and they turned me off when they slammed President Trump...they suck up to liberals big time...won't renew it.,1
It would be much better if this was available for iPad it is to hard to read on the iPhone.,1
"The magazine is fine, would rate it 4 stars.  Customer service is terrible and would rate it with negative stars if I could.",1
Very good! The recipes are great! It makes me want to cook up a storm!,4
LOVE HER MAGAZINE!!!,5
We love this magazine!  We live in a very rural area and having this magazine allows us to stay current with our rodeo friends!  Love this!,5
gave as a gift to Mr Wonderful...he sezs lots of useful information inside and well worth the price,5
You can get this magazine on the magazines website for 18.95 for one year or 24.00 for two years. I was amazed to see that amazon.com was more expensive!,1
It's not that there is anything wrong with this magazine but it just isn't as great as more mainstream car magazines.,3
"My wife and I both enjoy the wonderful and informative articles. Gives a perspective and insight that is hard to find elsewhere. Truly a ""must read"".",5
too technical,2
I bought this mag for my mom. She likes looking at all of the nice houses & getting ideas for her house.,4
Perhaps regular readers of this magazine aren't bothered by the ads but I found that this magazine contained more advertisements than actual reading material and projects.,3
"My 11 year old nephew loves sports.  Being a teacher, I want to make sure he is reading too.  He loves this subscription!",5
I have loved this magazine for years...I have enjoyed it just as much on my tablet!,5
Awesome  ,5
I just love those National Geographic magazines.  Traveler provides so many great images and descriptions for the traveler.  I use it for planning all of my vacations.,5
One of my favorite magazines to pick up and read. Finally broke down and purchased it online thru Amazon. I received my first issue in about three (3) weeks.,5
great magazine,5
"This ""magazine"" is at least 50% advertisement.",1
I love the fashion.,5
It turns out I never have time to watch TV so this was a useless purchase for me. If you have time to watch TV and want to know what's on then this is the purchase or you!,1
Love Martha Stewart Living!,5
Not particularly impressive. I was disappointed.,2
"Nice mag, but they dropped all articles about new Mustangs after I just bought a New GT",4
The service was quick and accurate except......the gift card made no mention that the gift given was a magazine subscription. The person receiving it had no idea what was given.,1
Enjoy stories and vocabulary challenge.,4
Cannot read well on google newsstand. Had to load to kindle,1
The best magazine out there for ideas and information about an island vacation. I literally read it cover-to-cover.,5
daughter likes it,4
very satisfied.,4
A lot of advertisement,3
The little boy I bought it for thinks it is amazing!  He loves it!,5
Where do I go for help in accessing my improved version? I have tried everything.,1
AWESOME!!  The best magazine on the planet!!,5
Amazing magazine. Love love love the information and ads given.,5
Contains some good ideas. An easy read with sufficient detail.,4
No cannot download the magazine. It says I have to pay for the subscription,1
It's not working well,2
"Very good, although wish started before 8PM in the day!",4
Great magizine but I wish they were sent in some sort of packaging because The front and back is always messed up by the time I get it. Other than that it's great!,4
"But really, it's only the paper edition. We were disappointed and, obviously, we didn't renew our subscription.  That's too bad.",2
"Acoustic issue, which was nice...",4
I like this magazine for primitives and country home design or decorative ideas. The magazine also has links and sites listed so that you are able to purchase these items.,4
Wonderful magazine for the aspiring back-yard astronomer or anyone interested in what is going on in our universe.  I am very pleased with the publication.,5
My mom loves Reader's Digest .,5
"Unfortunately, I canceled my subscription since they introduced the NEW version of Playboy. I didn't like it.",1
I found the print to small to read on my phone.  I was interested in the recipes but there was  a lot of  stuff including advertising that made magazine not interesting to me.,2
Okay miss the old style TV guide won't buy again,3
Great book,5
"Some issues are great;others are rather mediocre.  Still, it is probably worth the subscription price for those interested in keeping abreast of scientific developments.",4
"It was frustrating that I had to reverify my subscription after they changed the app, and that  I couldn't not retrieve copies of the older issues",2
I love this magazine. Its filled with a lot of accurate and current information geared toward young women.,5
"I have been reading Popular Mechanics for years, I find their articles more varied than before and very interesting.",4
I love this magazine. My 12 years old also liked a lot.,5
I have never received this product...I wonder what happened...I hope I am not paying for it...I have to check my records...,1
Gave this to my hubby for Xmas and he loves it.  Great magazine.,5
"Some of the articles are interesting, but you have to shuffle through a lot of ads. Would like to have more coupons.",3
Very up-to-date information/ well written,4
"It's OK, but I thought it would include graphics, pictures and the jokes!  Maybe it's been too long since I actually held the magazine in hand?",3
"Decent read, likely to renew.",3
this publication has changed. I'm 75 and remember a chock full weeks read,3
This has been one of the most helpful magazines re ADD/ADHD issues that I have come across. Would encourage anyone who is touched by this issue to subscribe.,4
I was disappointed about the contenance of this magazine. Did not find anything new or exiting. No practical information found.,1
It's alright for a gossip magazine,3
I love collecting recipes.  I am putting together a cook book for my kids and the grandchildren.  Really love this.,5
"I love coupons so getting the ALL You magazine w/out having to fight in the stores for it is GREAT. Thanks,",5
"I love this magazine, it is so informative and helpful. It has great articles, tips and facts for any women. Love it and will renew when the time comes",5
great recipes.,4
I love the print but why no version for the MS Surface??? Totally ridiculous. The Surface is a VERY popular tablet. They need to do some development there I think.,1
Have not yet received any magazines. I'm sure it will be fine once the subscription begins. Now when will that be?,1
"I, like many others, received the tote but no magazine.",1
I did not want auto-renewal so I cancelled it.,1
received as expected,4
Love this magazine and love that I can take it on my devices anywhere!,5
I love this publication. The articles are interesting and informative.,5
"Great. Love this mag,was a great price",5
I love Paula Dean and her magazine is great also and a good deal on the price from amazon,5
the company let my suscipt run out now it taking them 3 months to get me back on? no notice that you at the end of your year! It like they really don't want your business anyhow?,1
I love the Food Network but the magazine is not nearly as entertaining as my favorite shows.,3
Just what I was looking for my Grand son loves these.,5
I have been subscribing to the New Yorker for more than 60 years.  Why stop now?  It is excellent.,5
This is a great Magazine. I wish it would have been available 50 years ago.,5
Rifle Shooter is an interesting magazine.  More informative than most mags.  Usable information.,4
Arrives a little speraticly. But always in good shape.,4
Have been getting it for years....Love it !!!,5
"A truly wonderful magazine. If you are interested in the outdoors and Adirondacks, this mag. is a must. My husband reads each copy cover to cover.",5
"nothing of much interest, mostly ads",2
Not worth the money even at the discounted price . The magazine is prolific with ads and paltry on content.,1
not what I expected.,2
gift - they love it,5
Very good magazine I love it,5
Love It! Love her! So grateful to have this magazine in my life. It's a gem!!!,5
awesome magazine.,5
Wasn't quite what expected based on show that is oriented to building industry.  Nice easy read  but not a journal to the professional contractor,3
I love this magazine and to get it for a year for $5 I just couldn't pass it up! The ideas and recipes inside are great and you don't have to be rich to buy the ingredients.,5
"Have had magazine for years. Think I liked earlier better. More substance. Too many ads, pets and makeup",3
"I was first enticed by the free tote. Then I actually got the magazine and fell in love with it. It has great recipes and a great knowledge of good food.

Subscribe now",5
Love this magazine!  Lots of tips and recipes for all cooking levels.,5
"Thought I would like this magazine. It looked like it would be interesting enough, but I really don't care for it.",3
Does not seem to be my type magazine.,2
"To the best of my knowledge magazine has not yet been delivered to recipient. Can give review once delivery does happen.

Marianne",1
Way fewer recipes than I'd hoped. Tons of adds. But not bad.,3
Not for me - didn't find anything new to cook -,1
love it! great price.,5
Unfortunately it has become yet another resist Trump publication.  I  remember when the magazine was about the outdoors and backpacking not anymore,1
Best magazine! If I could only get one magazines e this would be it! Full of great decorating ideas along with amazing recipes and so much more!,5
One of my favorite women's magazine. They always lots of good and great diy ideas,5
"I have received this mag for years and love it.  I recenlty ordered it as a ""thank you gift"" for a friend.",5
Love it.  Thank you.,5
I have been a subscriber for over 20 years. I just canceled my subscription. They have gone in the wrong direction; basically removing all of the fun from the magazine.,1
"like the hobby itself it has declined.  Articles are fair, plenty of ads but not what it used to be.  Too bad.",3
"Love it!!!!!!
I always look forward to reading the next issue.",5
I can't review this product because I won't start receiving it until March. I didn't realize this was a subscription to a magazine. Poor advertising on this product,1
It said I would get magazine in the mail and through my amazon kindle.  I don't get it through my kindle.,1
Cheap. Threw it away immediately.,1
I got this one year subscription on sale for $5 and I am very happy with it. Getting it in the mail is a plus!,5
Too many advertisements not enough content.,2
Love this magazine. The illustrations are great as well as the articles.,5
Why request a review on an item that has not been shipped yet. Amazon failed me again!,1
Bought this for an 8 year old and he enjoys reading all the fun facts. Gets him off of electronics for a while.,4
This publication seems to focus more on real estate ads than critical reviews of those locations we might be interested in.,3
Go My 1st mag yesterday. It is 95% ads. For me it's junk and wast of money.,1
I like the magazine but found it was too hard to read a magazine on the kindle.  Don't like having to move around the page.,3
"Love this magazine, been reading for a long time.",5
"""Food Babe"" Vani Hari? Honestly? I didn't know this was a science fiction magazine. Say ""no"" to pseudo science.",1
love this magazine - it is only cookbook or magazine I pull recipes from...,5
Will not be re-ordering this magazine.,2
Problems receiving first issue,1
I would give it more stars if the online version worked on the Kindle.  Apparently there is some problem with the kindle version.,3
I BUY THESE FOR PEOPLE IN JAIL & PRISON. THEY LOVE THEM BECAUSE IT HELPS TO TAKE THEIR MINDS OFF THE BARBED WIRE AND CORRECTIONS OFFICERS.,5
"never anyting in it I am interested in  Certainly nothing suits our lifestyle, don't know hat more to say, bad choice.",1
"Liberal Rag, nothing helpful to speak of",1
"Money is a good solid ""Money Magazine"".  I still prefer Kiplinger the best.",4
"great issue about a great comedian!  This is a ""must have"" for any Robin Williams fan! Insight into a wonderful sol, gone but not forgotten...",5
I would be able to review this better if I actually receive the magazine!  Haven't seen it yet???!!!,1
"Got the first issue and then cancelled.  Lots of health info followed by a FULL PAGE AD FOR CIGARETTES.
Can you say hypocritical !!!!",1
There are way to few helpful articles in these PC World and some others. 80% ads and it's a waste of trees to make the paper.,1
Super bargain. The wife loves this magazine.,5
Terrible. Will not fully download. Worked fine until recently. Last two issues only download a few random pages.,1
"Sad, we only bought our Kindle a few months ago and publications like this have elected to be available only on Kindle Fire. Maybe Nook was a better deal after all.",1
I fell asleep twice.  That's enough for me not to order it,1
"if you love the western us, this is the mag for you,  excellent pics and well written articles for all",5
I read this magazine from cover to cover. I have subscribed to many; Quilters Newsletter Digest is my all time favorite.,5
"Packed full of interesting, fun facts.  Only problem is that it is too packed full. But we will keep picking it up and learning new things.",4
"I like magazine, I'm a subscriber myself. I ordered this subscription for my brother and he is yet to receive his first issue.",3
Great magazine. Love the designs and photos.,5
didn't find much in it,2
Always late,2
Best magazine ever!!,5
Disappointing,1
Great Magazine At A Great Price!,5
it is one of the best Christmas gifts I gave my wife. It just keeps on giving with each issue.,5
"I'm a Newsweek fan however, the photography is blurry and detracts from the articles,  dumped this before they could send me another free one.",1
"Nice pointers, and I do buy goods that carry their seal of approval.  Not the most exciting magazine on the market, but it's alright.",4
Martha Stewart is the best!,5
"i love elle magazine and I'm so happy that i can get it on my kindle fire. I love the layout of the app and how it reads like a print magazine, except I can zoom :) great app",5
"I got the tote and I get emails, but I have not gotten a magazine.",1
"For $5, it's hard to complain. I like most of the articles, but sometimes they tend to showcase expensive clothes/shoes that don't seem to be worth their price tag.",3
"The magazine is starting to have fair to much advertising and less pertinent info on ""Men's Health"".  I might have to switch to something else.",3
I love this magazine for decor and cooking ideas.,5
Many articles were surprising and interesting reads. My students could not put the magazine down.,3
bought as a gift - the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it took forever for my mom to get her first subscription and they didn't use the correct mailing address.,1
"Their website used to be an authority site. Now, they have turned it in to a pop ad, spam site? Its crap!",1
Save yourself a lot of trouble and just subscribe to Rock and Ice instead.,1
would like to see more health and wellness related articles. would also like to see some dressing and make up trends for seniors,3
This magazine covers all the essentials of staying up with men's fashion and interesting subjects that fulfill our inquiring minds.,4
Won't buy again. Too many advertisements.,1
My Favorite magazine,5
Many good articles,4
Great read! Just what I wanted ,5
To many ads otherwise it was pretty good. I like the non fiction and health articles The health articles that  have the ads to buy something is very annoying.,3
"Great merchandise, great transaction",4
Good value.  Magazine has some good ideas for new brides.  Alot of dress advertisements but some of the articles are good.,4
Good magazine at a good price. Fairly quick delivery. I would recommend it to anyone interested in lifestyle magazines. It is one of the few good ones left.,4
Hard to really view in tablet form.,3
Love it. Will keep after 30 day free trial.,5
Have subscribed for 22 years--love it!,5
"This mag has good photography and stories, for automotive enthusiasts. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading up on the latest motor trends.",4
No comment that's positive. Not what was advertised,1
Faulty DRM would not allow me to view the magazine on my Fire HD. Was forced by the app to remove the magazine.  Seriously annoyed.,1
I just love this magazine. The photos are excellent and there is always a freshness about it!,5
Needs a lot more work. Be more like the paper print. I Feel like I am reading a rough draft. Add more POP.,3
Only wish there were more horse classified ads in the magazine,4
"O is my favourite magazine - always chuckful of information, advice, recipes, suggestions and support .  These magazines are keepers and they are timeless.  Great columnists.",5
I've always liked Good Housekeeping,4
"You know it. I love it. Value for the money with lots of tips for home, yard, food, and decorating.",5
"Love this magazine, lots of good tips and articles.",5
Very difficult to read in this format,2
"My prime reading is worthless to me since I can only download to my Kindle.  Also, it would not open on my Kindle.  Boo.  Hiss.",1
This is regular sized.,3
Lackluster to the extreme.  Quality articles have been replaced by fluff pieces that read more like a teen magazine than the Time I remember.,3
love the magazine but subscribing was a hassle - thanks to Amazon for their help,4
It is great magazine with reliable articles that are of interest to all ages.  Great as a gift to a parent or grandparent.,4
Very good information,4
"ESPN tries hard, too hard.  This publication is a big disappointment and NEVER agree to auto-renewal because it is a giant rip-off.",1
"The printing is really small and difficult to read, even with bifocals.

The articles look like they are interesting.

Sorry I had to cancel my subscription.",2
Lots of great information.,5
Too expensive for my taste!,2
GQ Always great!,4
"I love Maxim. They have awesome product reviews, advice, and jokes. It's definitely my favorite magazine--well, along with Playboy.",5
Delivered quickly and has beautiful patterns.,5
Only three issues in 7 months,1
"Helpful advise, and great articles.",4
"I Love it,,,,Special Digital Deal",5
"i gave only 1 star as I haven't received the tote and pouch, magazine is fine",3
Love this magazine!! Great recipes. Great new ideas to add to your meal rotation. Healthy and most importantly easy to prepare and cook recipes!!,5
Best Magazine I have ever paid for. Always the most interesting stuff in them and samples!,5
dull; all advertising,2
Makes our food life very interesting and wonderful!,5
The magazine has gotten much smaller.,3
It was not as big of a magazine as I though it should be,3
"I find one decent article per issue and I like the last page where a male celebrity is interviewed .
Way too many ads!",3
"Used to be great, now nothing but ads and the stories are not half as compelling as they used to be.  Will not be renewing.",1
Fast shipping... Great price.,5
Age range says it is for 8 year olds -12 year olds but really aimed at 12-year-olds. Cancelled subscription. Lots of ads too.,1
Love this magiazing plain and simple,5
Not getting regularly...,2
It's just okay,3
Will not buy.  Too many adds.  To elites.  Down home girl here.,1
just trash,1
"Fantastic magazine for real cooks.  Watch the television show on PBS and if you like that, subscribe to this.",5
Wonderful periodical.,5
We love National Geographic magazine and we were able to get it for a great price here!,5
"I was expecting something a little different, but it was still informative. The franchise list could do a little more exposure and on the front pages.",3
One of my favorite magazines! Great reference.,5
"As many others have noted, there's precious little new or interesting information here. Popular Photography is basically one big ad, a shill for the camera equipment industry.",2
"Easy to read and it saves the page for you. I love it, there are no problems for me. Highly recommend it",5
I like it very much I got my first issue way before I was suppose to get it. I was surprised it came so early,3
How can I review something I have not received?  If Amazon is not going to send me the magazine refund my money!  Should be no star.,1
"Unless you like every decor in your home bright-colored, there is really no point reading this magazine.",2
"Have read P.S. since I was a teen.  Unique content, easy and fun read.",4
Purchased for grand kids.  They love it !  That makes me happy.,5
Amazing photography! Great food ideas.,4
11.99 per month for Canadians?  How can this possibly be justified.  It makes no sense.  Is this simply a case of greed?  Anyone care to comment?,1
"has a lot more ads than I expected. info is limited to a few recipes
no real stories, was ok but not the info I expected it would have",3
Great Magazine.  Hard to get rid of auto-renewal subscription.,1
"I would review this magazine if I received it!  It's been two months, and I have not yet seen one copy.",1
it's what it is,4
Crap since they took nudity out.. DON'T waste your time.  Articles are and always have been pretty crappy..,1
never got an issue,1
"The winter 2018 issue is the last printed issue .. received a letter from the publisher .. too bad, liked the charts .. rest of the magazine was sparse.",1
This may be good for someone else. But it was not for me. I think I got one and have no idea when or if the next one will come. Not a magazine I look forward to coming.,1
The best written cycle mag out there.  Shame Peter Egan is retiring!,5
There is really no reason to buy this magazine when all of the content is on-line (including all of the best stuff that doesn't make it to print).,1
I was under the impression that was getting 12  issues for 14.95 . So far all I've received  Is three.,1
To advanced for us.,3
Good source for new ideas.,4
I absolutely love this magazine! The pages are full of education. I learn something new with each edition. I would highly recommend to all Canon shooters.,5
My brother loves this magazine so I am happy to give this to him as a gift. He reads it cover to cover,5
"A fantastic magazine with great editorials, stories on pipe making and history. A must have for anyone who is a pipe smoker or enjoys collecting pipes.
KrustyWes on #pipes",5
I get this for my mom each year.  She loves it.,5
"Beautiful photography! Love the artwork, covers and articles. Channeling my inner ranch hand and dreaming of fantasy ranch property. Even the ads are pretty.",5
am not sad that subscription is running out.. was ok but not of great interest to me and no one interested in me passing it on to them,3
"Very honest reporting and as such can be a downer for some, while others may find it invigorating and inspirational.",4
Bought this for my granddaughter as a Chrismtas gift last year and just renewed the subscription for her.  She loves the magazine and looks forward to each issue!,5
"This magazine has great ideas, plenty of pictures to add to my idea binder, and I couldn't be happier with my subscription.",5
I really like the idea of reading the magazine on my iPad. Don't have to worry about having magazines laying around.,4
"Interesting articles, lots of beautiful images, and easy to access resources. A great addition to any studio or home reading collection.",4
You will know where will freeze over before your supscription is acted upon.  Gave up waiting for 2 months and cancelled.,1
"Nice pictures on the Kindle fire, but too hard to read.  I like the magazine so I'll continue to buy it (probably in print).",3
best price ever,5
"It's a good read but I'd like more diversity.  I had this subscription a couple years ago and it's fairly similar.  There's lots to discuss, bring the new articles!",4

Absolute best magazine available today.  I eagerly await each issue.,5
My 11 years daughter loves this magazine!,5

Read above. I have tried other magazines about diabetes and this one is tops. I have suggested to friends and family.,5
I'm happy with this magazine. Not my favorite but its for fun. It comes every month and goes right near the top of stack of magazines to read ;),4
Mostly ads - articles are far and few,3
"Love this magazine, love how easy it is to find the different food items to cook.",5
"It took nearly 9 months to for my sister to receive the first issue, a couple days after my she died.  Pathetic.",1
Love EW! This is my favorite magazine. There's something for everyone and I love all the exclusives for my favorite shows and new movies!,5
Did not like. The people in the magazine are not worth writing about!,1
I wanted to read the story of Audrey Hepburn otherwise sadly People has become far to political as has almost every other publication out there.,1
I've just terminated my subscription to Country Living because at least 60% of the content is about antiquing. Great if that's what you're interested in... but I'm not.,3
"My granddaughter loves this magazine. My daughter is reading it to her, daily. Ziggy always gives it to her mom so she can read it to her.",5
Excellent Mag. have been reading it for more then 8  years. coupled with digital & magazine makes it the best of both worlds,5
Will not download on my kindle.,1
Since I live on the Pa /WVborder I thought I would get this Magazine only the cover was different the whole magazine is page for page like the Pa  very disappointed,1
"Martha Stewart Living is a great magazine for any age or gender.  Martha and her staff are great cooks, bakers, and decorators. My grandma has this subscription and she loves it!",5
"I love Vogue magazine, but why do they insist on renewing in April when the subscription goes until July?  Next year I will take it off the auto renewal format.",1
It's ok. Articles kind of boring.,3
was given as a gift and they were pleased.. I forget that magazine subscriptions make very good gifts that continue to give,4
"I've been waiting over a month and have yeti to get the first issue. Although I'm eager for it, it's annoying to be asked to review a product I've yet to receive.",1
"I have not received this magazine yet from my order.
So I am not able to give my opinion yet.",1
grandson who is sports nut barely looks at,3
"Disappointed.  Way too many advertisements.
We own a vintage beach house. I was hoping for more articles on average coastal homes and towns. Not just high dollar properties.",2
I like the pics and the information provided. I would recommend the magazine. I especially liked the different ways it could be viewed on my kindle fire.,4
we love it!,5
Great if you have a device that can read it,4
I love this magazine. I have it on my Kindle and the pictures are wonderful. I absorb the entire issue.,5
"I love Reader's Digest, but the magazine seems to get smaller and the advertisements get larger with every issue.",3

Its one of my favorite cooking magazine!!!,5
"Terrific Magazine with LOTS of wonderful recipes.  The price was extremely reasonable, as well!!",5

"Excellent magazine, the best of the market!",5
Over hyped. No big insights or innovative concepts.,1
I ordered this magazine on 11/30 -- it is now 2/1 and it still has not arrived.  Can't really rate the magazine since I haven't gotten it yet.,1
They love it!,5
Has A Lot Of Info And Product. Data On Shooting Equipment For RIfle Shooters And New Products On Rifles Like Looks .,4
"The southern living magazine font is too small on a Kindle Fire 7"" and does not allow for zooming like other magazines allow.",1
Great mag. But the price is way to high!,4
The app is easy to navigate and read.,4
I enjoy this magazine and usually take a copy with me on trips.  It is one of the few magazines in which (almost) every article is interesting and thought provoking.,4
"Very helpful & easy to read, but I wish they would print the day time shows.",4
Worst ever,1
"Great magazine, last of a breed of intelligent automotive journalism. If you enjoy Automobiles this is the magazine. Rest assured.",5

Do not recommend.,1
Very interesting,4

Trashy mag.  Good gossip read.,4
"I like wired, and I like their strides to cover women in tech, but it still feels almost exclusively like a boys club. I guess as a woman in tech, I'm just not their audience.",3
Oprahs usual trash...,1
One of the best magazines ever,5
Always one of my favorite magazines.,5
I was hoping to read this more but frankly it doesn't hold my interest,3
Very informative articles. I'm looking forward to future issues.,4
It is my favorite cooking magazine.,5
"Great gift for my elderly parents.  So good that they passed it on to their friends after much bribing.
Major points for my on this gift.",5
I don't like Texas Monthly.  Never have.  Some people want it just 'cause it's about Texas but it's not worth it.  Read somebody else's copy.,1
This mag doesn't do its research.  Just saying something doesn't mean it is right.  Its that simple.,1
Great price. Love redbook,5
Great price for cosmopolitan. Love it,5
Go this magazine for my 13 yr. old grandson who loves to fish and hunt.  He loved it so much it is an automatic renewal!,5

Very good for animal lovers and kids. I love this,5
This Good publication is somewhat deminished by inaccurate information.  What an awful shame that sponsor money seems to dictate opinion.,1
I've loved these magazines have since I was five. Highly suggest for kids!,5
A great Christmas gift that keeps on giving all year....,5
Not Great by any means. But still has some good info and articles.,4
Best motorcycle magazine.  Objective and truthful source of information about all things motorcycle.,5
Christmas present for son and grandson.  My favorite motorheads love the magazine so I keep re-subscribing.  The price is unbeatable.,5
Much like my fellow readers I must express my disdain for the excessive pricing of this digital offering.,4
Not nearly as good as it used to be.  I would say it has about half the content it once had.,3
I still have not received my first issue and the price was not really much of a deal,1
I have been trying to cancel People magazine. I.do not want it again,1
Country Living Magazine  I love country decorating and also love cottage design. This magazine is not what I hoped for.,5
I don't even miss the paper.  It is a great version.  My only complaint is that it does not appear in the kindle newsstand as easily as others.,4
I wish they had more articles about cigar and their history. I'm new to the world of cigars,3
Not as good as the one I get from the Newsstands it has more adds it seems boring to me,3
I got this subscription for my 9 year old and he opens it and pores over each page as soon the magazine arrives. This really appeals to his already great love of sports!,5
"if you love mid-century modern, you'll love this magazine!",5
I have a regular postal subscription. I have tried ten times to add a digital edition to it. No Luck!!,1

"I liked that I received it, but on the first night of reading, I nearly finished it!",3
This is my favorite magazine and it was a great value!,5

Exactly as I remembered from years ago. I have the time to read again so looked for this publication and was glad to find it.,5

"I have orderd House beautiful magazine since September 18, 2006 and to date, January 8th I have not receive such subscriptions.  I would like someone to look into this please.",1
"I like the magazine, but I gave it only three stars because I read the magazine for entertainment news, not for policitical correct opinions which I do not agree with.",2
Proof of Heaven was a disappointment.  It was a lot of neurological detail that is not an easy read for a lay person.,3
Easier to look on line -- just a bunch of recipes and ads.,4
I do NOT like auto renewal.  I want control not my dam machine controlling my life.,1
Have read Readers Digest for years...great stories & articles in a condensed formula.,5

"Too many advertisements, and the stuff advertised is way too expensive. $1500 for a skirt?! This magazine lacks content.",2

Could not access kept redirecting me to an invalid site. Hate it.,1
I ordered this magazine on 8/12/09 - it is today 9/12/09 and I have yet to even receive one issue. Way to go Amazon... or Maxim - whoever managed to screw this up.,1
1 star for a magazine that pushes an ill-informed fear-monger. I can't respect a magazine that would do this,1
From the magazine description I expected to be rivited at the turn of every page. Didn't happen the way I imagined. It's Ok at best.,3
Never noticed how terribly biased Time has become ...,1
"Most of our family on our account has the original Kindle Fire, which this isn't compatible with. Really stupid. Will not renew because only one of us can read it.",1

More a political rag mag now.",2

"The best in pop literature ever it has everything movies,tv,books,podcast you name it it has it.",5
Fun projects with good plans. Interesting articles.,4
This is a good magazine. But if you have an Ipad they give you the print and e edition for 5.00 here its 2 dollars plus a month. That drags me,3
My grandson loves it,5

Full of useful ideas,4
Cosmopolitan is an okay magazine not really interesting nothing that I would reccomend just to anyone but it is okay.,3

I saw this magazine while at a beauty salon; I loved it the first time I saw it...So I came home and ordered it promptly... I love it...,5
Little content of interest to me.,2
Too hard to read on cell phone. Content very good.,4
Philosophy Now has accessible articles that anyone can enjoy from the lay person to more sophisticated reader of philosophical perspective.,4

Have not received any issues since purchase.,1
Got my TWO issues today- don't appreciate getting the current one and last months' at the same time. It's like getting 11 issues for the price of 12.,1
"The magazine is good, good put together, easy to open with any device. No zoom when you open inner pages. Not my style of articles, too superficial.",4
"I have not received my first magazine yet, hence no review. SLOW Item number 1 is not accurate but it would not except my review without some thing in the stars.",1
Bago products came as thy described. Well stitched well made.,4
I needed Vanity Fair for Kindle with the ability to enlarge text. Could not do that,1

I buy this all the time. I have had a subscription for it for years.. It is one of the best magazines out there,5

"Nat'l Geographic never disappoints.  Fabulous photos of anything and everything, here and across the world.  You can't beat Nat'l Geo.",5

This is the best wood working magazine I have ever found!,5
Wired magazine is one of the very few magazines that I actually read from cover to cover. Every month I find myself indulging in its contents. Highly recommended,5
Way too many ads basically when you take all of them out there's not much left,2
G&A and Firearms News seem to have morphed into very similar publications. Doesn't make sense to pay for both.,2
Great to have D&DH at my finger tips no matter where I am. Easy to navigate too!,5
"Their work out are very effective if you comply with the guideliness for each move and routine. I love it!!!

My husband loves this magazine and reads it cover to cover then is sent to my son who does the same,5
This has got to be one of the poorest written magazines I have ever taken the time to read. Especially in kindle form.,1
Great Product  Fast Shipping A+++,5
I thought American craft would be a bit more detailed and inspiring.  Not so,3
"I paid for ONE YEAR! I got the first three magazines, and then they just stopped coming in the mail! Where is the rest?!",1

Best Magazine Ever For Men or Women!!!,5

Way too many advertisements.,2

More fashion focused. Not very into fitness. More like look like your into fitness while shopping for groceries.,2
I have had other issues of this magazine before so I know I will like it once it starts to come.,4
I was supremely disappointed with the bag and subscription. I wanted more depth to the subscription and higher quality from the bag.,2

Always a favorite magazine of mine.,5

"This magazine contains tobacco advertisements. Wouldn't be a problem, but I ordered it for my son.",1
Auto-renewal with zero communication it was going to take place. A reminder or two would have been optimal.,1
This was a great bargain!  Amazon was the only place I could get both print copy and copy.,5
"I have not been able to read the magazine, because it states, ""Your magazine download is in progress.""",1
"l mostly flip through Elle these days as it doesn't really offer me much actually interesting substance. It's not bad, but it's annoyingly full of ads.",2
This magazine is nothing more the ads and propaganda. Trying to reach our vulnerable children and teach them about secularism. Sick sick.,1
Nice  but small than expected.,3
More advertisements than articles.,2
was unable to read magazine it would not open only opened to shop advisor,1
I love this magazine. And I received this year subscription for less then $15. Saving me a lot of money yearly! Always such good articles!!,5
Disappointed with the Book Review.,2
I tried to cancel the order 1 day after placing it. I had thought my subscription had run out when it really was just late. Totally impossible to cancel,1
I was confused to receive my first issue with three back ordered ones? Pretty bummed because we had already purchased them during our travels.,1

One of my FAVORITE Magazines! I wouldn't live w/ out it!  Thanx!  Artchalet @ msn.com,5
The language is a little liberal and slanted. The photographs are well done and the double tap text is great for reading.,4
Until now I have never received my 1st issues for my subscription. I ordered on around the 1st of August.,1
"You can order it directly from National Geographic for $15, but that is just the magazine not the online stuff.

Great product!! Arrived sooner than expected too!!,5
Too many ad's and not enough articles. Many years ago when I read Cosmopolitan they had some informative articles I do not find this is the case any longer.,2
This was my first issue and I like the content and the magazine.  I can't wait for the next issue to arrive.,4
Price was way too high but everyone else's was too.,2
Love the paper but managing the subscription has been a nightmare.  Probably won't renew again.,1
Great interesting articles.,4
Not sure that I like the automatic renewal.,3
Disappointed with the design of the magazine. I couldn't get into the content.,2

"I have never received a single issue and nobody has solved my problem in the 9 months I have had my ""subscription"" with them.  Just save your money and avoid it.",1
Some of the writing was clinical and detached. Some was very lively and fun. The poetry was nice. Very good value for the money.,4
It was raining the day my mag was delievered so it was a little wet. In the past I got mags and they came in a clear plastic bag. Prevents the mag from getting wet.,3

Love Martha and this a great deal,5
after the editor of the nation came out for obama and had such negative remarks about clinton on larry king s program.....the nation will no longer be on my kindle.,1
not much content anymore. it is all ads. seems the articles are crafted to try and place more products in article.,3
"I ordered a subscription and 3 months later, I still have not received a copy yet.",1

They make apps/software for the UK but not the US??? wow......",1
"Though I love the content, its a lot of ads to filter through just to get to the content. Love the way kindle handles the pages!",4
Best magazine ever!!!!,5
Its not as good as it was in 1980s but there are still a lot of fun puzzles.,4
"You had a highlight/Cover piece on food babe.
With that said how can anyone take what's in your mag seriously.",1
"Full of color, great articles, wonderful pictures and ideas. Most of all, full of Martha with the same wisdom and humor that her program had.  This magazine is a keeper.",5
some good science in there,3
"This magazine never fails to deliver a great read.  Look forward to the next issue ever month. Filled with great recepies, ideas and current fashion trends in one place.",5
A wonderful magazine with wonderful recipes.  Thanks kindle for bringing this to my attention.  I've purchased two issues so far and have not been been dissatisfied.,4
Through academic subscription I can get the print copy delivered for $75. This quoted price for an electronic version is outrageous.,1
We looked forward to each magazine. But had the whole thing done quickly. They're short.,4
Not enough real news - too much fluff.,2
Have always loved Sunset magazine!,5
Can't read it -- the Kindle Fire version is intermittently terrible. the content may be just fine but due to continuing problems with my Kindle Fire I cannot read it.,1

Do not order your subscription to this magazine on Amazon.",1
"Everything that used to be good has gone to the dogs these days, including Taste of Home magazine! The Liberalites have taken over. Sad!",1
"seems like the recipes are changed a little, but mainly the same thing all the time.  Good for someone who never cooks, but I have gotten maybe one recipe out the book lately.",3
This magazine has a lot of graphic sexual content and political bias that I don't want my kids exposed to. Just as well they don't like it anyway,1
I only got this because they used to have a vocabulary list...  I'm so dissatisfied that that's no longer apart of the magazine... But if read some cool articles...,3
Waste of money. Doesn't have daytime listings or what shows are about. Can see the same thing online.,1
it came too earlycrossing withmy wife's subscription. Hers runs out in September. I will be getting double issues until then.,3
I did not want this renewed....please let me know if you are planning to renew anything else without my permission. Thank you.,1
Pseudoscience and disrespecting your audience? No thanks.,1
I can't get it to open so it's useless to me.,1
It was okay but over priced,3

Great mag. but not suitable to read on tablet.,4

bunch of garbage,1

This is overall a good magazine.  I like the reviews and have tried a few of their recipes with much success.,4

"The Digest's cartoon in the December issue would be inappropriate in any magazine but in a Catholic magazine it borders on disgusting and blasphemous!!!

L. Giarratano",1

Been reading Reader's Digest for 51 years.  Not about to stop now.,5
Has a lot of short descriptions and a lot of items. The larger articles are pretty good. The magazine is not as good as smart money but they went out of business...,4
I get this magazine and comments are Right..Nothing but ads! If I wanted to see ads I would just watch TV!,1
90% ads . . . I wanted something that would help me in my career.  This ain't it,1

Good magazine for unbiased product reviews.  I don't like it that they hit me up for a donation a few times a year.,4
Disappointing.,1

I'm very please with my subscription.  Every issue is on time and filled with all kinds of ideas!  Thank you!,5

great magazine for women of color,5
Easy and relaxing to read and covers many different parts of the world but not in enough depth.,4
As a long term subscriber I cannot believe how they have destroyed the magazine. I will not renew.,1
One of the best magazines around.  I have subscribed for years to this magazine it is so informative.,5

I can't wait for this magazine to come every month - great articles!! Great for both a cyclist and a road racing fan.,5
There's such a large emphasis on wedding dresses. The magazine is pretty much just pictures of dresses. I subscribed to 2 wedding magazines and they're both really disappointing.,2
"Not what I thought I was buying. Too many advertisements. Pictures of people I don't know, no idea where to purchase items",2
Lots of fun and interesting information that you won't easily find elsewhere.,4
It is garbage no reason to waste your money or resources to print it.,1
It's not a bad magazine but it sure could be better. My real complaint is that every where and everything they recommend/suggest/etc. is well beyond most peoples financial realm,3
So tired of the same stuff in every issue...not worth the 5 bucks I spent!,1
LOVE THIS MAGAZINE!,5
I thought this was a magazine about nice pickup trucks not a for sale and parts catalog.  Do not like it!,1
The renewal subscription started before my current subscription ended.,1
SAME AMOUNT OF JUNK ADS AS MOST OTHERS IN FIELD.,2

This magazine sucks!!,1
Although I understand the reason I have yet to receive the magazine it is still rather irritating.,1

Never received.,1
"Too many models and celebrities and too many ads. If I looked like a model or a celebrity, I wouldn't need this magazine. Not for the ""Common Jane"".",2
Send old issues to count as part of the new subscription.  Not right,1
"I got this for my husband and ordered another magazine at the same time.  The other magazine arrived a couple of weeks ago, but still no Road & Track!  Bummer!",1
This magazine really is about the pictures...the articles have no real significance...but is that the point?,3
Dumb and so self serving.,1
Lovely magazine.  Great ideas and very good recipes.,4
Never got the digital issues.  Contacted Amazon - they couldn't figure it out.  If you are purchasing this so you can read them digitally you won't be able to so don't bother.,1
"Useless, more political than scientific, WAY to many ads.  Don't subscribe.",1
Love Fast Company content. But impossible to read on the Kindle Fire. Any ideas that would make it more readable -- like the 'print view' in NYT.,2

"Ordered two subscriptions in December, here it is Feb 8th and I still have not recieved a copy.",1

"Great magazine, been reading it for years. Have learned a lot from it.",5
This magazine has changed a lot from when I would get it years ago...too many ads for my liking.,3
THE MAGAZINE IS SMALLER AND LESS PAGES THAN I EXPECTED. MANY OF THE ARTICLES WERE REPEATED FROM EARLIER ISSUES. DIDN'T GIVE THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT I THOYGHT IT WOULD.,3
"Equus is one of my favorite mags! It has great medical information and interesting pictures. Plus, they have an inspiring horse story in each issue.",5
This was the best price I could find on the internet.  My husband loves this magazine. He reads it cover to cover.,5
"I have not yet received a single issue of this magazine. I am still waiting, but I did see that the fees for the magazine went out of my card.
This is bad!",1
"my great granddaughter loves her magazine and anticipates each new arrival. She is 3+ and well into the magazine

I expected more information on muzzleloaders instead of advertisements.  I have been shooting muzzleloaders for over 35 years so I guess i set my expectations too high.,2

magazine has too many adds not enough mens health,3

ok articles,3
"National Geographic is another magazine I just can't do without.  The photographs are the very best in the printed world, and leave little to immagine.",5
I've only received two issues so far. Unless the future issues are a lot better I will not renew.,1
Full of advertisement and other s***ty crap. I'm surprised it's still in print.,1
I bought this for my husband and paid $15 for two years. We have gotten 1 issue in 3 months and 5 bills saying we owe $10. This is an awful deal.,1

"I bought two subscriptions, one for each of my Grand-sons. I just love this publication. The subscription prize was just right.",5
Ive never received this on my Kindle although I was charged the $3.00 for the one issue.  thanks,1
Changed there formate.greared for younger reader. Not as good as it housed to be,3
love to keep up with sports this is one great way to do so,5
If you are interested in home improvement or home projects you have to have this magazine. I have subscribed for years and always will. Always something new and different.,5
"I am a long time subscriber to Texas Monthly and have received the past two monthly issues previously, Why would I want to re-read the same old crap?",1
"It Took Over 2 Months to Start my Subscription. But now that it's begun, it's a great magazine and always arrives before the date on the cover.",4
mag not all that good.  not even good enough to go through a second time as I usually do with mags.,1
"If you want sex positions and sex toys, this is the mag for you.  Lots of beauty & fashion stuff for the mid-30s and under crowd.  If you're 35 or more, you're beyond this mag. mb",3
Not much real info. Too much crunch with little actual substance,2
"This Magazine used to be great.
But unfortunately it is TERRIBLE.
If you doubt this, check out and compare an ""old edition"" online and ""new one""
It is now a total WASTE of paper.",1
Favorite pet magazine that I get.  originally sread it at the dentist office and ordered it ever year since.  Fun and informative.,5

Very rudimentary publication. Would not order again.,2
"I never ordered this product. It just showed up on my Kindle. How do I get this out of my Kindle.

Thank you,
Edward Hobbie",1
Not modest enough.,2
"received 3 issues, then it stopped, and we have been getting renewal requests since then.  Do not purchase this ever!!!",1
same thing. I haven't recvd the 1st issue yet. It looks fine from the covers I have seen and I have read it in the past. But I need to actually receive it to rate it properly.,1
I purchased a digital and print subscription and my kindle had only received one copy of men's health.,1
Too many advirtisements did not like it,2
Not as good as Seventeen. Most product introduce/advertise in this magazine are towards to the higher end (upscale) market which most teen does not have the ability to purchase.,2
I was supposed to get 6 issues and i only recieved 3.,1
Was easy to read but awkward going from actual magazine to kindle version,3

Took advantage of a special to get a year's subscription to Popular Science. I have enjoyed reading the magazine but probably will not renew.,4
I used to get this years ago. Not as good as before. Smaller format and less content.,3
My only problem with it is that I can't keep the older editions when the new one comes out. I'm quite miffed about that. But the magazine itself is usually quite good.,3
My elderly father loves this. This is an excellent magazine for the amateur sky watcher. Enough science to keep the mind stimulated and wonderful exciting photos of our universe.,5
Great magazine and great fashions. I like the fact that they also tell you where you can purchase them.,4
"Although I like reading some of the magazine, I do
find that the recipes, generally, have too many ingredients
and they are too expensive.  I wouldn't renew my supscription.",3
"My favorite magazine, wonderful variety.",5
"I have received the physical Conde Nast Traveler magazine, which I love. I have not received the digital version.",1
Got this for my wife. She loves it. So many good articles and great recipes.,5
"Barron's Magazine - Unable to buy ""current issue""; Kept switching to monthly ($12.99) when I put in credit card info for single issue ($4.99). Buggy!!!",1
"I've taken the Country Living Magazine
for over 30 years and love it.
Love the variety of things that it provides
the reader.",5
I sent my granny a year subscription to Quiltmaker and she loved it. It has beautiful quits & patterns in there. Highly recommended to anyone who loves designing quilts.,5
I love this magazine. They share super recipes and make healthy eating a more upbeat and attractive plan! The cookbooks are awesome too!,5
I didn't even order this publication and somehow I started receiving these in the mail. Very sneaky however this was even ordered.,1
I give this magazine to my niece for her birthday every year and she loves it!  It makes shopping for her very easy!,5
"I am dissapointed at the fact that I only got one magazine. I am gonna try again.
I wonder what happened to my money",1
I bought a 12 month subscription through an Amazon offer that costs me less than the price of a single magazine;I can't think of a better deal I've ever had.,4
The new format is terrible,1
I love having this magazine in Spanish. My children are using it to keep up with their Spanish reading skills.,5
There were not many good articles in here.,3
I enjoy  this  magazine. It is interesting  and has many useful  articles. I would strongly recommend it to preachers and all who value their religion .,4
"Yes, I've taken P.S. Life for years and enjoy it",4
I got the report that my young granddaughter dearly loves her first issue of Disney Princess! This was a great gift idea--I love gifts that encourage kids to read.,5
Great magazine but only received three issues for 12 month Subscription,2
I was quoted a price of $5.00 and was charged $12.95 for this Travel & Leisure subscription.  I tried to correct it but just finally gave up.,1
Great articles but to many adds,3
"Like the Mag but got it so I could view it on like too
That doesn't  work when you buy it form Amazon",1
My print copy hasn't been coming and the label says my subscriptions is good through December 2016,3
This magazine has become so boring! Disappointed in the content and reviews.,1
Got 1 or 2 issues! Waste of money,1
I look forward to the magazine every week.,5
"National Geographic is the best!  For years my parents shared their copies with me.  Now that I'm an adult orphan, I have to subscribe for myself.",5
"SUBSCRIPTION SUCKS!!!! ordered for my son and so far only received 1 magazine.  Really,  thieves.  Deserves no stars.",1
Good luck reading this on a smart phone or kindle. The text is so small you'll spend half your rine pinching the screen and the other half cursing.,1
Im a huge country living fun but this Jan/feb issue is super boring and really small,1
Mostly bead weaving pattens.  I prefer more variety like Bead and Button.,3
I really wanted to love this but the majority of the magazine is just ad after ad. It felt like i was paying to get a book of advertisements rather than beauty articles.,2
perfect to start or end your day  it is timely and to the point  this is my second year and I love to read and meditate on the prayers,5
This has a lot of beautiful patterns..Love this magazine. Well worth it !,5
Dense with information on a vast variety of topics. Well worth every penny.,5
Can't locate the magazine on my kindle! Very unfortunate. Also can't get help from Amazon as they hide their telephone number better than a virgin hides her panties!,1
"I really am enjoying this magazine. There are many recipes that are excellent, easy to make with available ingredients. Also interesting articles on fashion.",4
I do not have a pad and wanted to read my Wired on line via my Mac.  Can't do it.,1
I've read the reviews where it's nothing but fluff.  I still enjoy it.  If we didn't have pretenious people in the world we wouldn't know what pretenious was.,4
Disappointed by content and digital style which was non-existent.,2
MY GRAND CHILDREN LOVE THIS....I WILL BE SENDING IT TO ALL AGAIN THIS CHRISTMAS.....GREAT PRESENT AND INTERESTING FOR ALL AGES,5
I have always loved vf's writing and whimsy. The online mag is well laid out and easy to navigate. Buy!,5
I love that I got a whole year of this for only $5! What a steal! Happy to finally have some magazines!,5
I have been getting this magazine for years and still love it.  Great price too!,5
A fancy food magazine. Interesting articles but odd recipes. It would be nice for those looking to really expand their cooking tastes but I found it not so useful for my kitchen.,3
The issues come sporadically. I've missed several.,3
Love the ideas and pics !!,5
We like the Magazine  But  we don't want the auto renewal,1
I ordered the magazine and was charged over a month ago.  So far no first issue has been reviewed so I can't really review.,1
"I realise that this magazine is for the young, single and dating. I have outgrown Coso sob! On the other hand the lay out was great on my kindle. I loved manoeuvering  the pages.",5
Strictly for the PROFESSIONAL.,3
Highly recommend for 6 year old and up.,5
"Terrific Magazine, great ideas, plans, etc!",5
ok magazine...but has lots and lots of ads!!!!,3
"I have read this publication for many years, enjoying content on movies, music, books, reviews, etc. This is a great publication to keep informed with all media...",5
National Geographic bought by Rupert Murdock. That explains all the advertising. ,2
"Interesting, but no longer a guide to the newer technologies.",3
Cannot see the small print on my Kindle.  Content aimed at much younger audience.,1
can't figure out how to view digital version.  what a rip. :(,1
I prefer Taste of Home Magazine.,3
"good overall magazine ,it has mostly sport bike articles",4
Would have absolutely loved !!this subscription had I kept getting it....I received 2 and haven't gotten another one!,1
Have loved Analog since I was a teen-ager. Still great today. Reading stories on my Kindle makes it even better.,5
Compelling lyrical short stories well worth the read.,4
Have been subscribing to this magazine for about 12 years..Lots of good tech and practical information..I re-upped with this time with Amazon for less $$$'s,4
Pretty good magazine but they canceled my subscription 4 months before it was supposed to end.,3
These arrived much faster than expected.  What a great deal!  My kids love them.,5
Great value.  Magazine arrives promptly and is used in my office waiting room.  A great magazine for women of any age,4
The savings Amazon offered on this magazine subscription was outstanding and ordering online is so convenient.,4
An excellent all inclusive magazinefor the avid hunter and fisherman. I've been reading this magazine ever since I was a little kid and I am 43 now.,5
"I subscribed most of my adult life.  I finally discontinued because the magazine is now more ""Popular People of Science""  and less about the science itself.",1
Most of the recipes are easy to follow and do not require too many specialty ingredients. I enjoyed the magazine.,4
"Interesting, informative articles and exotic recipes.",4
The TV Guide is no longer a complete listing of the TV shows that are on the evening. It has become a useless publication and I will not my renew my subscription,1
"I bought this for myself and then for my sister. We both love it!! Great variety of dishes, tips, techniques, ideas, and all our favorite chefs!! Worth every penny!",5
Love having a subscription to this beautifully made and inspiring magazine.  There are tons of recipes and decorating ideas.,5
I have been ripped off by Amazon.  Never received magazine and emails go unanswered.  Buy elsewhere.,1
My 13 year old son LOVES the magazine!!,5
Don't like that you can only read the magazine vertically instead of horizontally. I have the iPad 12.9 and it would just be more comfortable if vogue had the option. :(,3
I have been a subscriber for 45+ years and it is still the best in its genre.,5
"It's ok! It first has too many ads. And you need to love fashion to read this magazine, otherwise you will be bored! That's all that is in this magazine.",3
I don't like it.  It focuses too much on what the stars are wearing and not enough stories.  I won't renew it.,3
"Never got this on My Kindle fire, did not download. It did work on our I-Pad mini.",1
"It you live in Canada be warned,magazine is always late by at least one issue,their customer service very unhelpful. buy it at the newsstand.",1
Eh... kind of interesting.  The LP is going in the toilet a bit so I'm losing interest.  Probably unfair to penalize Reason for that though.,3
Not worth the cost. Glitchy.,1
"Love to read about shows, programs, specials , and extra articles!",5
Wonderful magazine full of beautiful images and interesting artist reviews,5
what drivel - one large makeup ad,1
"Fantastic magazine, look forward to it every Friday, lots of great articles, upcoming sales and auctions, lots of useful information, very interesting and entertaining.",5
This is a wonderful magazine for anyone interested in reefkeeping.  The topics are discussed in depth and the photography is awesome.  This magazine is worth every penny.,5
This is really one of the best magazines - so well done.  Excellent range of content and it's all about my beautiful state.  If you're an outdoor enthusiast so much the better.,5
"Works as inspiration for decorating, cooking, or as a dream get-away moment. I've kept all of my issues to enjoy when the winter snows come.",4
I still have not received a copy on my Kindle.,1
"Love it, my favorite!",5

I love Marie Claire magazine. I read it cover to cover every month and I couldn't pass up this deal!!,5
"Trash, but interesting.  Lynne from Sellersville",4
Just like current history I cannot navigate this publication on my Amazon fire tablet,1
one of the best magazines,5
"Definitely thought it would be coming within the next month, not at the start of 2017. Oh well.",3
Too much advertising! I'm tired of getting more and more ads each month. I've been a subscriber for years but I will cancel due to this issue.,2
"No longer meets my satisfaction.
Wish to cancel tnis subscription before delivery.",1
Both as a gift but I think it is over priced for all that is in it.,3
I am not a vegetarian but love this magazine because it gives me different ideas for side dishes or if we do a meatless meal!,4
I love this publication. It is always interesting. A good magazine for your break room. Id buy it again for myself.,5
incredibly useful magazine full of great tips/advice.  Always find something I can use and especially helpful for my kitchen remodel,5
Poor format and articles are not presented very interestingly.,2

For years I used to buy Chatelaine over the conter.  I luv so many of the Canadian comfort food and holiday dishes and the articales that are in the magazine. I luv it,3
This magazine has a lot of interesting information.  I am a beginner so I don't understand everything just yet.  Hopefully I will catch on soon and be able to comprehend it all.,4
"I really enjoyed the content of this magazine, however, I get a monthly charge of $0.99 and have yet to get any content since my initial subscription.",4
This was the best book I have ever read. It's very inspiring and eye opening. I loved it so much.,5
What a refreshing magazine. It has story's in every era.,4
The magazine is very thin without a lot of substance. Bought as a gift for my father and he found them disappointing and not like it used to be.,2
Very poor print quality.,1
Love this large print.  It is so much easier to read.  I always liked Reader's Digest and this large print makes it so much better.,5
SINCE MY ORDER OF 6/1 STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE FIRST ISSUE FROM SUBSCRIPTION TO RC MAGAZINE???,1
"As usually  ""Scientific American""  contains handful of contemporary excellent materials written by professionals of highest rank.

I have an active subscription which i cant download,1
"didn't get it/ wasn't received/ it was never mailed to me/ must be on flight 370/
somebody's dog ate it/ was it on the hindenberg?",1
TOO YOUNG FOR ME,3
heavily weighted with advertisements,2

"had seen the magazine inthe doctors office, So decided to order,. Very pleased. Liked the craft info thats in them",4
My wife loves this.,5
To me its not the magazine it used to be. I now quite often find it very confusing.,2
It is hard to move around within the magazine.  Difficult to read because of the very small print on my Kindle Fire.  Because of the format I can't increase the size of the print.,1
Nice layout; easy for little ones to go through. A few more pages would be welcomed.,4
Great Mag.,4
Some good recipes but really seems like every other page is an advertisement as the time goes on.,3
Too many ads not enough articles.,2
I didn't like all the advertising.  Not enough recipes. Not worth the money.,2
"This is a great magazine. I have subscribed to it for as long as I can remember. It is full of great advice, new product information, etc. I love it and HIGHLY recommend it!!",5
Awesome articles and pictures. I love ready from this magazine and learning from this source.,5
I have received this magazine for many years and it helps me set up the DVR for the week. I circle the programs that I am going to program.,4
Wonderful for keeping up to date and finding new products and ways to use them,5
"As always, this magazine exceeds my exectations.  I learn valuable new tips with every issue.
Sharon Weeks",5
I made a mistake. i meant 5 stars. i appreciate access to book reviews of books wjich ordinaroly would not be found in bookstores where i live.,1
Great Magazine has lots of information that will us go self-sufficient.,5
Absolutely love this magazine!,5

"Son liked this publication, but it's now too expensive",3
"For those with country decorating in mind, for sure.",3
Excellent daily devotional and aid in preparing for Mass. Also wonderful articles and Saint biographies.,5

I don't like auto renewal. I never order your magazines because of it. Wish you got rid of auto renewal.,1
Great information on investing!,4
My favorite magazine at an all time amazing price!! Thank you Amazon!,5
Fun read.,4
Not good at all.,1
"I renewed a subscription for someone on your ""renew site"" and now the magazine comes to me instead of the gift recipient.  Not good.",1
One of my all-time favorite magazines! Great value.,5
"waste of paper, etc. stick to online content. this magazine's primary purpose is to advertise paints.",1
This is a good magazine. They have redone the inside since the last time I read it. The format is much better now.,3
This subscription was for my son. He enjoys the Sports Illustrated magazine. This makes a great gift for teenage boys.,4
Love every issue. Can't be without. Look forward every week to the interesting stories.,5
Daughter loves the magazine. Lots of coupons. Lots of great recipes. Absolutely the best magazine I've had in a long time. A bit pricey.,5

"Horrible, It was nothing but ads. I am not impressed at all.",1
"I love, love, love, this magazine!!",5
"I liked it so well I ordered the DVDs set of every issue of Handloader ever published from Wolfe publishing. If you hand load, this magazine is a must for you.",5
How can I review this when I haven't got it yet? I will never buy a magazine subscription from Amazon again. Almost 2 months and I haven't received anything yet!,1
Magazine is great but the emails are a nuisance. Once subscribed it seems there are lots of offers for stuff.,3
Not as dynamic as I was hoping.,3
Magazine is quite small.  Not a lot of articles anymore.  A lot of ads.  Probably won't get it again.,3
I am 72 years old. I don't feel the same about the magazine as I did when I was a teenager. But I think that is normal.....I hope.,3
"In my opinion, it doesn't have alot of content and might as well subscribe to their facebook page and get it there for free",3
"I used to love PM, but these days its like a hollow shell of its previous form.",2
"I love this magazine...it has everything that I'm into:  The styles, the looks, the makeup, the celebs and more.. Great magazine..it's worth the money!!",5
"We have read Historia y Vida since the '70s and it has always kept it's high standards,it is the best historical reading ever.",5
Great magazine!  Arrived promptly!,5
I'm not sure that this magazine is what I remembered.  It seems more family oriented and even my granchildren are grown now.,3
My favorite magazine for women over 40. Price was good too.,4
"I got my first digital last week. I really like it, but I am waiting for the magazine to start.",3
"terrible.  bought a subscription for my mother, last december, and as of today, 7-16-15, she has only received two books.  I would not recommend this subscription to anyone.",1
Enjoy reading it very much. Have been reading it for several years.,4
Some issues are full of great projects and some are real stinkers.  Guess opinions vary.,3
Great magazine! Wonderful articles and home town life.,5
"Small fold out, only a couple pages. Was looking for something a little bigger and solid for my 6 year old. This is like something you get at a restaurant.",3
"not deep enough on the ""technical"" side.",2
"Love it, and you cannot beat the price.",5
when i actually get the magazine/.,3
"Takes a few months for delivery, but always liked the magazine.",4

I like the running tips .  It is published bi-monthly.,4

This was a great price for this treat. I enjoy it immensely.,5
Husband loves this,5
My daughter love's it,5
"I cannot read the magazine. The zoom function does not work as in another magazines. I hope they will fix it soon. if not, i will not renew my subscription.",1
Not pleased only received one magazine since July,1
great buy on an essential magazine for TV viewing.  I will auto-renew every year through Amazon.  Husband and I share it.,5
Love these!,5
Each issue seems to have a limited scope - one or few topics or people - if you're not into that topic or person then pretty much the whole issue is a bust.,2
"Love this magazine , all about coastal decorating and beautiful places to see. Definitely a great magazine to purchase",5
I can't find this magazine on my kindle,1
My only complaint is constantly getting renewal messages in the mail. I received one even before getting the first issue.,4
"I really don't care for the humor, though I support their right to express their views.",4
"Not as good as it used to be, but okay.",3
I have not received the magazine yet!! It was paid on September. 14th!!! Not happy!! It is now October 18th!!!!,1
I did not order this.  I have no idea how rhis happened,1
I've always liked this magazine,4
"I like the good housekeeping magazine, the
price was unbeatable, and the subscrption
was started very fast.",4
"Gone 21st century and that isn't an improvement in my book.  Used to love this mag, but highly disappointed in its current state.",2
It said I would be getting 8 issues. I got 4. Do not subscribe to this. Its not worth it.,1
Good pictures and recipes but way to much advertising.,3
The rest of the magazine leaves a lot to be desired.  Not too much interesting stuff.  It is poorly written and not interesting.,2
This mag is a total waste of paper. One month is just a copy of the previous month with a different cover,1
"Nice magazine, of course, but the view i can get through the kindle pprwhite is definitely bad. Not recommended for this kindle.",2
Not really keeping up with the times in a young girls life...at least not here in the urban areas.  Need to address current life more,3
I find that this magazine is too full of advertising and not enough of the guitar lessons material I was looking for.  I won't re-subscribe.,2
Maxim has gone downhill over the years.  More of a yuppie mag now than appealing to the average Joe.,3
NO BOOBS !! articles are still ok!,3
I was very disappointed this is strictly a trials magazine full of ads.  No real rabbit hunting.  I would not buy,1
Great price through Amazon!  Love Food Network magazine!,5
"Did not like the magazine. Too outrageous. Plus, they tried to charge me more than the initial subscription fee 3 months later.",1
i would rather buy hustler then pudhouse,1
It has been well past when my order should have arrived with no luck,1
So much more advertising than actual articles.  I was hoping with the advertising they would list already existing log homes for sale.,2
Probably the least well written of all the hunting and fishing magazines on the market.,2
"This is one of the worse magazines I have picked up in years.  If you have ""money to burn"" traveling, then it might be for you.  Loaded with advertising and little 'true' content.",1
I've always liked this magazine.  I am not a fantastic knitter but like to dream about projects as I enjoy magazine.,4
I renewed this magazine for my daughter.  She loves all the fashion magazines and the price on this couldn't be beat (2 years for $7.00),5
every kids loves,5
Great magazine. As always I am able to travel many places and learn so much more of the world.....just by sitting and reading. The photography has always amazed me.,5
Once upon a time WIRED wrote articles that focused on technology. The End.,1
Not impressed at all; tote set was thin and very cheaply made,1
Unbeatable price for fantastic content. Really love the broad range of innovative science they cover. I would give one to any niece or nephew.,5
A good source of young mind info,4
Never was able to access,1
"Since I have a windows tablet, I have no access to magazines, even though I have been a prime member for several years. Makes me want to cancel my prime membership.",1
I don't feel the articles are as good as they used to be....but.....then...i don't always look at this for the articles.,3
"This is the first time I have used the ""Electronic"" Edition of the publication...it's great!  And the content is as it always has been...thought provoking and inspiring.",5
"So nice to have this to read, and cheaper than subscription and Newstand.",5
Got it for the office reception room.  Women did pick them up and browsed them.  No substance.  Lots of pics.,3
"""Men"" magazines are now targeting ""women""?  Not for me!  Cancel please.",1
Not very interesting.,2
No recipes I wanted in the first issue,1
Sent as a gift to grandson and son. They look forward to every edition!  Happy with the choice I made.,5

ITS CALLED SPIN TO WIN RODEO BUT IT ISN'T ABOUT THE RODEO,1
I have always liked House Beautiful. I got it for a good price so was really happy with this purchase.,4
Just another cookbook magazine.  Recipes are a little hard to follow.,3
If a 5 month subscription is $114 then each magazine would be $22. I think savings listed is false advertising.,1
"I have been looking for a daily meditation and daily prayers. This is exactly what I have been wanting and needing, so glad to have found it!",5
"It was easy to do, but I wish an acknowledgment would be sent by the company which receives it in the end.",3
I have not received any issues yet.  I would like to know when I will get my first issue.  I've seen new ones on the newstand since I paid for my subscription.,1
Better than most other similar magazines. Easy reading. Perhaps a bit simplistic for experienced handymen who already know many of the tips offered.,4
"Excellent! Informative, insightful and useful",5
"SOme months lots of good ideas, some months now to many. Still like it though.",4
My 9 year old says it's the best magazine ever and looks forward to it every month. I think it's a great way to encourage literacy.,5

The other reviewer was right. It's a bait and switch. I cannot download on my Kindle.  What crooks!,1

Very nice magazine...,4
Ordered for my husband and he loves it!,5
Anyone interested in how the mind works can't help but be fascinated by nearly every article in each issue.,4
A great magazine for dog lovers,5
I guess they ran out of credible sources things to write about so no need to buy it now.  Seriously - The Food Babe???????  Who is the editor for this ragazine,1
"good articles and clear instructions.  Tends to not have the ""here's what I've done and I recommend it"" type articles as much as the ""muscle"" type mags.",4
I would like more articles on the Food Network programs and personnel and fewer recipes.  I can get all the recipes I want on Epicurious.com or other sites.,3
"Didn't order it, just called to have it stopped. Looked at it and not interested.",1
I love the magazine - I hate that I can't tap it and make it a readers page. The page can only be magnified.,3
Suddenly the content moved from Centris to Left / Progressive and from unbiased truthful reporting to biased propaganda.  I canceled.,1
Too much adverting and little content,2

"This was a great Magazine when  a couple years ago.  Now the coupons are practically worthless and when the subscription expires, it won't be renewed.",3
A great magazine to read and study with a good variety of  subject fields but a little too heavy on the green agenda. For the most part very intriguing,4
Maybe I just picked the wrong month to give it a try.  Seemed to be all about politics.,3
"Nice magazine, good photos.",4

Too many ads. Just a few articles.,3

Wish they wouldnt always put skinny people on the cover show real women we are all sizes even plus size and we workout too,1
Best way to follow daily mass with devotional at the end.  Love it!,5
Used to buy this magazine years ago and loved all the tips. Unfortunately now instead of a lot of great ideas it is mostly advertisements.,2
Takes a llllloooonnnngggg time to load. Ridiculously long.,1

Best magazine I found so far.,5
I love this and the price. Great information that pays for itself.,5

I absolutely love this magazine and have gleaned loads of tips and ideas from it since getting pregnant last year. Highly recommend! And a great gift idea for new mums!,5
Great magazine for Eastern US railroad news and photos. I use it for work reference material and as a railfan.,5
I don't find I learn anything  new anymore :(  I used to love this magazine but I can get more current info online I guess.,3
Like all the web sites listed but no help in learn to work within them. Would like a better how to mag.,3
The only thing I don't like about this mag is the fact that you are always flipping to the back to read the rest of the article. Great travel ideas.,4
Love the magazine and the price. Been reading it and enjoying the stories,5
I've been reading this magazine for years and its getting better and better every year! I love it every time!,5
This is a wonderful publication.  I can't wait until it arrives and I immediately read it from cover to cover.  I just received my second issue and I'm sold.,5
Reminds me of a pseudo-intellectual communist p.o.s. rag.,1
"Excellent to be able to read a magazine electronically, as I have asthma and can't buy the real thing. Great fun!",5
There seems to be only pics in magazine.. no real articles and even the pics are not of interest to me.. . did not find it useful,1
do not suggest buying this for kindle paperwhite no pictures and confusing format.  I barely read it it was horrible.,1
The magazine covers an overall spectrum in order to touch on areas of interest for all individuals,4
Magazine renewal was good but for some reason my existing subscription wasn't used as a base to add my renewal..,3
Meaningless!!! just page after page ad...content is nothing to be excited about...Don't buy,1
Photos and text look small in Kindle and they can not be enlarged. I deleted it and frankly I don't see use for it.,1
"I love this magazine, I've been a reader for years. It has a good mix of fun, informative, and inspirational articles.",5
Our granddaughter loves this magazine. We have purchased it as a gift for her for 3 years,5
"I have not received even one issue yet, what seems to be the problem?????? I am giving no stars whatsoever, and I demand an explanation!",1
"U CHEAT YOUR CUSTOMERS . NEVER RECEIVED BUT ONE. MAGAZINE. MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.
U PROBABLY SCREW EVERYONE LIKE THAT.

LARRY HUBBARD
RE. LWHUBRD@AOL.COM",1
"If you like any off road magazines, this one is a must.  Great rock crawling coverage.  Nice and thick!",5
If we ever receive the first issue that would be good!! We keep on getting notices from First to renew....,3
Love the writing as well as the photography! Great for cooks who love to try new cuisines!,5
I couldn't download my subscription. And customer service couldn't really do anything to help me. I received my hard copy subscription but was unable to download my digital copy,1
"Pretty good read. Most frustrating part, most articles are written for moms or from a mom's perspective.",4
Reading this magazine on a Kindle is difficult because of the text size. I plan on cancelling this subscription forever.,1
"Used to be a great magazine, not so much anymore.",3
"It is a great to get back to the Review and have intelligent, well written reviews that tell just enough but not too much.",4
"Great magazine, great intro price but watch out for the full price renewal $$$!",4
I got the magazine when I thought it would never get here. I got the free scarf but never got the other two booklets. Not really that impressed.,1
informative but I unfortunately don't have the extra time to read it all before it's already old news.,3
I have enjoyed iCreate for almost 2 years now and each issue has added value to my Mac experience.,4
"Not quite what I'd hoped for - a lot on fishing, not so much on wildlife.  I'll give it until the subscription runs out....",3
A magazine which propagates half-truths and full lies is not what our world needs.,1
So far it seems to be too much adds.,3
I never ordered this!!!!,1
I order the 1 year for five dollars and sadly I have only received two magazines. Very unhappy.,1
Like most mags today too many adds,3
Very good price.,4
A great publication for pilots.,5
"This is my favorite magazine.  Therefore, I give gift subscriptions to my friends.  This was the best rate I could find.  You made me & a friend happy.",5
Wish I hadn't subscribed,2
My wife just loves the magazine and love her cooking from it.  The recipes are memorable and magazine is a steal for the tips inside it.,5
Love it.  I recently purchased a home in Shadow Hills and look forward to hearing about everything thats going on in the Valley,5
"Great magazine with home planning ideas. Terrible delivery, received first issue over 2 months late with no explanation!",1
I love Sunset magazine but don't love the pile up of them. I like the fact that I get all of the beauty and knowledge of the magazine without the clutter.,4
"Ad, ad, and ad...nothing interesting. Is a waste of time...",1
"Yes, it has some informative articles but just cant seem to ""grab my attention"" to keep viewing. Will not be re-ordering.",3
"Magazine keeps you in touch with respect to new equipment (i.e., advertisments especially but also product reviews) and some technique. But just too many damn advertisements.",3
I love this magazine so much!  I just wish there were more than 6 issues a year. Awesome DIY ideas!,5
"i have had this magazine before and its great, only problem is i don't get my first issue until july. thats sad.",3
Nice Ideas for a handy person.,4
never got the messenger bag,1
"Pottery Making has many good ideas and projects, especially for teachers of pottery and for children. The articles are clearly written and easy to understand. I enjoy reading it.",4
Content not worth the price. Bad customer service,1
love the magazine wish it had more street stock stuff though,4
I'm still waiting to see my first copy. What a disappointment as I really wanted to read the January issue!,1
"Don't know why I get this magazine other than I'm kind of a celebrity ""voyeur."" It's fun to see current pics and updates of the people we see on TV and the big screen.",4
Excellent quality and timely delivery,5
"what a joke ordered a monthly subscription on january 03,2018.....and today is March 21, 2018... WERE IS IT....BETTER YET CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION",1
Ok magazine,3
"Well, if I was supposed to receive a tote bag, I did not.  However, the magazine meets all my expectations and I do get daily email updates from the magazine",3
My very favorite magazine; never disappoints.,5
"For the wife, she is the magazine freak here,as I prefer to use my time elsewhere.",3
Only received one issue and then their systems altered my address and have yet to receive more issues or the bag. Fail so far.,1
"I love this, I get the print magazine and love the interactive parts of the digital magazine",5
"Mostly advertisement, not too much nail art.",2
I don't know why I get this publication I don't want it but yet it shows up every month!!  this is not for me.,1
"It's a shame that the Economist, and probably to a lesser degree Amazon, are trying to gouge their customers after they've spent so much time and energy building goodwill.",1
My son loves this magazine!  He looks forward to each issue. ESPN is a great magaine for men. Keep up the good articles!!!,5
The best!  Couldn't be without it.,5
I'm sure my nieces will enjoy this but I ordered it at Christmas and it is scheduled to arrive  mid March,3
I absolutely love this magazine!  Great decorating ideas!!!!,5
Worth the yearly subscription price,4
"Resubscribes you without giving you the discounted subscription later, will not work with you, they just want your money, unfair",1
"great pictures from all over the country but a little ""religious"" sometimes",4
"I'm sure it's a pretty good mag, but I'll never know, because it will not download to either my Kindle or my PC.",3
"This publication illustrates some good reasons why science and politics make strange bedfellows. Then again, the title should have warned me.",3
More ads than articles sadly. The ads are aimed at women (90% have a woman in the ad if there is a human featured) I won't be subscribing again.,2
Great. Magazine.  My favorite,5
Very irritating that this e magazine is unable to download to an iPad.,1
And good luck finding out how to cancel or reverse charges. I wonder how many others have this charge lurking in their CC statements.,1
Magazine is pretty thin. Good Q&A but not worth the cover price (to me).,3
"I got this mag for the man in my life thinking it was about sports. But with this cover I'm not happy. If ur a porn mag, say so. Don't cover it up. Be truthful in advertising.",1
"I enjoy the coupons, the articles are ok/somewhat helpful. I've bought a few issues before and need a few more to really decide whether this magazine is worth the subscription.",3
This is one of my favorite magazines. It's great to take with while waiting for an appointment. There are always so many interesting articles and pictures.,5
Hugh variety of articles regarding current and historical subjects with wonderful pull-out expansion maps and pictures.  This is the best magazine on the market.,5
First off you get it after it hits the news stands which is annyoing. Secondly why can't you just do a yearly subscription? Don't recommend at all,1
"Interestesting article. I enjoyed it, but it was rather pricey for a single copy of a digital magazine.",4
Cancelled order. I just like the physical magazine.,1
The magazine seemed light on information.  I researched and found I could access the same type of information online for free.,1
I love the magazine but the subscription start was slow.  I ordered it on Oct 25th but just got my first one on Dec 10th,3
Mr granddaughter in-law just loves this magazine.,5
Wish listings were by channel numbers instead of channel names although I know this is impractical.,1
I enjoy the layout very much and the magazine is very inspiring,5
Great Mag..!!,4
Great magazine for women.  I have been a loyal Marie Claire subscriber for years.  I find hardcopy magazines still my favorite.,5
Nothing to read really. It took me not even 15 minutes to finish reading the whole magazine.,1
I do not like it because it was purchased as a Christmas gift for our grandson and he has not recieved it and it looks like not until March.,1
I used to love this publication.  I have been subscribing to it for 48 years.  I am canceling my subscription this year.  It has turned into political propaganda for liberals.,1
Limited (boring) articles; too many advertisements; worthless. I will not renew.,1
"The big 4 car mags are all about the same.  That being said, I love them all.  This one is no exception.  Great pictures, great articles, and reasonable reviews.",5
"Only reason to buy this is the insider access on ESPN.com.  This goes straight in the trash.  If you have to read it, take some aspirin!",1
Semi decent magazine. Seems like there are more adds than articles but I still get some information from it. Not sure if I'll renew though,3
"I love this magazine.  Mostly positive, good stories about stars.  There is some television stuff
in it as well as crossword puzzles and such.  Really enjoy the read.",4
"Some content was really good, but the adds to content balance just didn't work for me.  Pretty sure it was at least 60/40 ads to content.",3
This magazine is not for the casual photographer.  Lots of technical info.  Wish  it would have had more info on how to take great pictures.,2
Used to love it. Obviously over the top left-ist now. The New Yorker does not support our great country.,1
"Great magazine , very good content + great fashion. Love it!!!",5
"Would not download more than the first three pages, cannot remove the unreadable issue from my kindle.",1
Too many adds...,3
Waste of time and paper.,1
"it should be renamed national people magazine, it used to be about far away and exotic places, now it about people instead like Picasso ,in this months magazine",1
"I ordered this subsciption in June, and it's now mid-September....I have yet to see a single magazine.",1
"This was just put on my account, no notice or anything. I barely have time to read magazines and I just planned to let my subscription runout but they had other plans apparently.",1
My favorite :),5
"Dislike, feels pretty narcissistic to me",1
"Always a great magazine but I don't want the printed version thank you.......

"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this magazine.  Soooo many informative articles about health and living.  Lots of tips and pointers that will keep you going.",5
My son loves animals and is always so excited to see his special magazine and it gives us extra time together reading through it.,4
"I always enjoy reading. A great combination of news and entertainment. Love the covers, as well. True works of art.",5
this magazine is excellent for planning. My first issue arrived damaged.,4
I got this for my 7 year old son and he loves it.,5

The best magazine written for progressive values,5

"Boomers are probably the leading readers of the Mag. We want info. pertaining to us. Also, reprint old jokes, we won't remember them~! lol",1
My husband is the head of a college Automotive Technology department.  He's read all of the mags put out there for auto enthusiasts and loves this one by far.,5
"I really do love this magazine, they always have great ideas and wonderful tips!  One of my favorite parts is the last page...the things kids say...so cute!",5
Live out in western NY where its hard to find a paper carrying national news so this fit the bill nicely. Also love doing the crossword puzzle!,5
I signed up as a gift for my husband. The two that we received are the Kids version.,1
I am a hardcore conservative but I find it to be a thoughtful and interesting read.  out!,4
"I love this magazine and it's even better delivered to my door! Love the articles and the recipes. I couldn't beat the great price, either!",5
daughter loves this magazine and the price was great,5
"Got an unwanted advertising notification, tried to find where to turn it off, couldn't, so I guess you must accept it like it or not",1
The only problem is that there is no information about the A.M. programming.,3
I miss the good old days when Oprah was relevant.,4
Was disappointed. Only gave TV listings from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM even on weekends.,1
While I ordered a subscription for my son I would not know but what I do know is I only received one issue for him since ordering.,1

Every issue makes me want to visit or move to Maui.  Beautiful Photography and interesting articles. What else could you ask for.,5
Wonderful photograph,5
Hands down the best photo mag I have ever had the pleasure of reading...WELL worth the money!  It is the only magazine that I have read cover to cover...every time!  Get it!,5
Great magazine. Can't live without it.,5
"expensive, I thought there would be more to it",3
Favorite food magazine. I've loved it since I was ten.,5
I thought this would be more gluten free and/or paleo.  I cancelled this after the first reading.,1
I could not find one recipe that I liked or would use for my family.,1
Disappointed that local channels for my specific location are not included and that programming from 12 AM to 12 midnight are not shown.,2
This has been ordered for over a month.  Still haven't received it.  Good luck.,1
Not the magazine I used to love.  A waste of time and money now unfortunate it used to be really good.,1

Only adds and very cheap printing
I feel sorry that I have a subscription on that
I should buy food for homeless dogs!!",1

Great magazine as always.  :),5
Bought it for my Nana. She loves it,5
No need to weigh in on transgender. I was very disappointed that NG felt the need. Will not renew.,1
Terrible magazine. Ok so it does have great pictures but very disappointing intellectually.,1
Only worth reading if other people are hoarding tabloid magazines.,4

I love this magazine so much good information each month,5
Not the mag it was 30 yrs ago.,1
This is my favorite magazine...Great articles on all the newest gadgets that every guy wants...Plus some beautiful girls help as well...,5

I just received my first issue in October..........and I can't seem to put it down. Very entertaining!",5
"I ordered this magazine on July 31, 2007.  Today is December 14th and I haven't seen it yet.  I'm sure it will probably be a good magazine if I ever get it!",1
This magazine seems to get thinner every year with more space taken up by Copenhagen and Skoal ads than actual articles. A Legendary publication that needs more substance back.,3
"I would never be without this magazine. It goes way beyond the news headlines. Precise, in-depth reporting on everything plus great photography. This is my world information!!",5
Too much advertisement,3
print was too small and I was unable to use Kindle feature to enlarge it.  Was unable to read it.,1
It is non-partisan and very informative of the week's major news stories.; I have been getting this magazine for 6 years now and truly love it..  Great articles and stories.,5

The best magazine and best writing in America.,5
First issue of my subscription arrived within 3 weeks of ordering online. Also liked the fact I could find a 6 month subscription for under $22. Very impressed!,4
Good magazine.  Great price.  My husband travels a great deal and did not want to renew this subscription.  He wished it was more geared towards walleye fishing.,4
Terrible magazine now.  Nothing like years ago.  It was mostly advertisements.,1
"Expected more articles on foods, recipes and nutrition.",3
"I like the magazine and its content, as does my daughter, but we are getting no response to customer service issues.  It did take months for the first magazine to arrive.",3
Nowhere does it say whether the $9.99 price is for an annual or monthly subscription !!How deceptive is that ??,1
"Love the magazine, but it is not for an Android. The other items are great, but this one displays the whole page.",3
"don't like not being able to view across all devices including pc and mac
cost enough i should have access were ever i want",2
i like to study turquoise and silver and red stones and settings and this is the best,5
Ok but not for rural areas more bigger city options,3
They omit various sections - no real rhyme or reason - just poor quality control,1

with good enough content.",4
Too many exotic cars in this magazine. Some useful info but mostly fluff.,3
GQ?  P-U!,1
"Along with Woman's World, I read this magazine cover to cover and highly recommend it.  Interesting, informative and easy to read articles.",5
"The O magazine is great and Amazon offered a great deal.  Great articles, pictures and enjoyable to read.",5
didn't get many issues,1
Filled with ads and sneaky product placement! The stories are weak and  too many pointless crafts that you could easily look up on Pinterest. Firefly is so so much better.,2
you will receive maybe 2 or 3 magazines after that none!. Beware fraud! its not just me review all comments before ordering,1
I love this magazine I read it from cover to cover,5
I liked the Art News of the 60s through the 90s. I am considering dropping my subscription to this magazine. Art Educator and artist.,4

Most of the recipes I would not make.,2
"I did not want this subscription to continue. I got it free, but they ended up charging me a ton at the end, even though I tried to cancel it. Way too expensive.",1
Best hunting magazine currently produced.,5
Be careful with auto-renewal option. Just received auto-renewal for 1 year at the rate of $29.95 !  NOT a good deal on 2nd year.,1
"An article on July 7, A TEEN MAGAZINE GIVING DETAILS ON HOW TO HAVE ANAL SEX. LOVE AMAZON. REALLY HOPE THEY STOP SELLING THIS MAGAZINE ""FOR TEENAGERS""",1
"National Geographic kids is the USA Today of children's magazines. If your child has a genuine interest in animals or nature, look elsewhere.",2
I agree that this company is one to avoid.  Here is their toll free number.. someone actually does answer it... (877)893-7885.,1
Love love love the large print,5
canceled it,1
Its okay.  I am used to the older style of Popular Science magazines.  Just something missing.,3
Best magazine subscription ever!,5
for my great granddaughters.  will renew.,5
This magazine is mostly ad's.,2
"As a couponer, I look forward to getting this each month.  It is a great coupon resourse and easily pays for itself.",5
Poor history.,1
Not quit what I expected.  The articles are a bit of a letdown and are more preachy that substance.  I will not renew my subscription.,2
"I want to end the subscription, but can't see any way to do thatt. DON't BUY! You will be forever stuck.",1
Decent magazine but can be expensive.,3
One of the best.,5

"Won't renew, very disappointed by all the adverts, lack of content.",2
"My husband LOVES this magazine. It is just technical enough to keep his interest, but not too much to where he can't understand the articles. It is a great gift subscription.",5
"Very informative magazine, nice recipes. Visually appealing.",4
I find the magazine has many interesting and informative articles that even a 68 year old guy can find educational.,4
"My grandson loves this magazine! He is 16 and has often commented and quotes on stories on what he's read.

.",5
My daughter looked forward to getting this magazine every month! Great read!,5
This is not a magazine.  There is no content.  It does not seem that the issues were delivered either. Save your money,1
"this is a front for advertizers selling pharmaceuticals.  Wow!!  Not a decent recipe, just ads for pills.",1
"Wired used to be a great magazine. Recently, its become overly political and its articles have been reduced in quality and quantity. Save yourself the money. Even if its on sale.",1

"Another purchase to read while I'm laid up after a upcoming surgery, like to see some options of in home businesses.",4

awful thin!!,1
"Ive always enjoyed this magazine- its informative, educational and supportive of my family needs for home, school and work life.",5
We recently moved to the St. Louis area.  This magazine is chock full of information concerning events in the St. Louis area. Easy and enjoyable read.,5
Boring...can't think of anything else to say.  Just not interesting enough to keep on reading it.  Was for a boy who is very smart.,1
Little value in this but didn't expect it.  Just got it for a reception room and it served its purpose,3
"Interest in this magazine, good coverage of day to day living and very good presentation.
I like to receive it at home",4
I got two issues in 1.5 years and they said its up for renwal. Do not buy,1

Love ESPN!,5
Ordered by mistake. I do not like the product. I do not watch television. I would like subscription canceled.,1

Gunner  January, 2008",5

SO many advertisements.,2

"Still reading through the book, but it has some nice ideas and is organized rather well.",4

Uts the best newpaper,5
"A Great Magazine for Men & Women with the Best in Humor, Cartoons, Jokes and Advice, with Incredible Articles and the World's Most Beautiful Women.",5
"My girls love this. If you want your children to have a deeper understanding of mass, then this is perfect for them",5

Girl friend loves this mag,5
"I've been subscribing to this magazine since it first came out, and never plan on missing an edition! Simple, timely, and great for a vegetarian household.",5

I've been reading this magazine for 25 years and is always a pleasure.,5
You could not pay me to buy this horrible magazine again.,1
Sex every single page. Seriously this magazine needs to arrive in a black bag because it is comparable to porn.,1
the kindle user won't bother with the paper version so it is not an issue that if you offer lower price on kindle the sales will drop. exactly the opposite.,1
"it's just not the same as the real magazine,yet it will do maybe it will improve over time.we'll just see",3
"Not as good with new publisher... Magazine is shrinking in size :(  Still great informaiton, just less of it.",3
"...not what i expected, but it is the price guide...i hope the regular mag is more informational.",3
Nothing too in-depth but very interesting.  I bought it as a general entertainment read and it does not disappoint.  A must to foster an interest in science for younger readers.,4
This magazine is about 80% advertising with very little actual articles. Very disappointed,1
Did not enjoy. A waste of money.,1
Not embracing the radical changes.  May grow on me.,2

I ordered this magazine for my daughter. The recipes are very easy to understand and use. The articles are interesting too.,4

It is my favorite magazine. Every single page is exciting for me. I also  recommended a hot book for the cosmo girls Sex and the perfect lover snd the Kamsutra by Mabel Iam,5
Playboy is history. The articles now in Maxim are much better since there is a new owner/publisher..,1
Essence Magazine is great!! It is filled with reliable information and also provides articles that stimulate growth. I am glad that I finally renewed my subscription.,5

Great publication to keep up with the world of automobiles. A must for any auto enthusiasts who dares to dream!,5

"I will never buy this magazine again.  It would not work on my kindle, and when I tried to download again, got charged again!",1
Best price for this subscription.,5

Great for FL gardeners. Love it!,5
"I was looking for something different to read.  I like the magazine, but really don't find that much I actually love.  Translation, a nice read, but nothing to write home about.",3
More for the runabout owner ..,3
It is alright. I like other magazines better. Ones with more things for the house. Also ones about clothes and household hints.,3
Lousy recipes waste of $,1
"never liked play bore lol it shows nothing i want to see on a woman's body
hustler and taboo are for me",1
"This is not the Better Homes my mom subscribes to.  Not by far. Fancy photos, good color suggestions, but all too  impractical.",2

In Canada we buy the US edition of the Economist at the newstands. Why on earth is it not available on Kindle?,1

It is great and it will undoubtedly help me as I work with our 4 year old horse. Thank you!,3
"Not great, more for the beginning investor.  I will not renew my subscription",3
Not sure what I think of this... I either did not order it or accidentally ordered it.  I have no use for this magazine and I certainly hope I am not charged monthly or annually.,1

The readers digest never disappoints. great thought provoking articles,5
Love the magazine but wish I could receive it promptly every month.,4
Glad the free clutch is not the reason I subscribed to Vogue.,1
Not what I remember from when it first began publishing.  Content is not that engaging.,2
On a one-year subscription I only received the first three issues.  Great magazine but unreliable service.,2

Love this magazine!  Has great ideas and is definitely a must for people who love Shabby Chic!  Would definitely recommend.,5

enjoyable informative,4

Fox News with nice photos? No thanks.  Murdoch ruins everything he touches.,1

It doesn't appear on the amazon.com.au site.",1

It should change it's name to TV News.",1

Too liberal Please cancel,1

I didn't want to renew and this just came.,2
"i hate this magazine.  it always comes late, if at all.  i don't have any problems with the other magazines i subscribe to.  buyer beware!",1
Kindle format made it difficult to navigate and the articles were dry... it can be challenging to bring life to heavy scientific topics,2
It's mostly for marathon runners. I do 5K's otherwise good information.,3
"Love this magazine,ine",5
Very light reading. Maybe only 5-6 articles an issue. You get what you pay for,3
Not as many recipes as expected.  The recipes were also not that time efficient either. Was also over priced for what you got.,3
Ordered this subscription in January. Received one issue in February. Nothing else arriving.,1
can read through them in about twenty minutes.  Too many ads.,3
Nice magazine to give as a gift and easy to send via amazon. My friends love it And I like sending it,4

Got this as a gift for my son's wife.  he likes it very much.,4
I haven't received it . Not very good service from you guys . probably won't make that mistake again .,1

Like this magazine and has some good articels.  Also get Bark.  This has a bit to many ads but still overall pretty good.,4
"This mag is gorgeous....the recipes and articles are so well done, sometimes I just love to look at the pictures!",5
Some parts of the MAD magazine are still entertaining but has lost a lot of its oomph from previous years.,3
Great rate on a great magazine.,5
ess homm piece of junk,1
Great magazine. Worst app ever.,1
Bad choice for me,1
I have always loved this magazine- it is the best-I read it from cover to cover-always bought it at the store-so can't wait until I get it.,5
"My wife loves this magazine, and I was able to get an amazing deal for a two year subscription.  It was less than a three issues at the new stand price",5
I just read the first issue.  It wasn't that great.  Hopefully it will get better.,3
Excellent publishing,5
"AS of JUly 5, 2012, I have not received any magazines. I will galdly fill out your survey when I receieve a magazine",1
"Even though I'm Australian and our deer species are different the fundamentals are the same, this magazine is a must read",4
I have been subscibing for over 30 years now and Amazon offers the absolutely best rates.  Extending an exiting subscription couldn't be easier or more reasonable.,5

My little girls love this magazine.,5
Love the articles. Very realistic :) fav article Breathe.,5
Nice magazine but would like a little more traditional look to it.,3
Gave it as a gift that had been asked for. I apologized for the content and he agreed it was not what he had expected.,3
I would review this but since I have not recieved it nor any communication about it I don't feel qualified to do so.,1
The just TOO TOO TOO MANY ADS IN MAGAZINES TODAY. CONTENT IS THIN AND UNINSPIRED,2
Liked the magazine but rarely have time to prepare such intricate meals. I am switching to something lighter this year,3
"love this edgy, hipster mag....can skew a bit young sometimes, but I love their music suggestions and factory girl feature.",4
Disappointed.,1
There is hardly any content in this magazine and the formatting of what content is there makes it hard to read. Not recommended,1
"Great read, kids loved it",5
This magazine used to be cutting edge...  now its one big advertisement... 34 full page adds out of 88 for one issue... its soI used to look forward to each issue.  Not anymore!,3
Fun magazine for home improvement,4
I just wish there was a way to see the Graphics on the app...but all in all - it is quite nice,4
I love this magazine lots of home ideas. I love organizing so this is the perfect mag for me. Great Deal!,5
The first issue was very readable but subsequent issues not so much. Maybe the content was not interesting to me.,3
Such a one sided magazine. These articles don't provide two views only one from the far left what a shame.,1
"Love everything about this magazine. Beautiful photos, great design inspiration, lovely recipes.",5
"only received one and it came to my address not the designated address, I want a complete refund.",1
Great magazine at a great price,5
US doesn't pack the lunch that people does -- too many ads and not enough pix and gossip.  I plan on cancelling this as soon as I can.,2

All advertising...awful.,1

Love love love this magazin!,5
"I ordered this magzine two-months ago, but nothing has showed up even today. Do you want to wait longer?",1
Got the hat but not a single issue of the magazine.  (4 months later).  Subscribe at your own risk!!!!,1
"Seems to  have good information. Too early to tell if I would renew this subscription, also ordered Texas Monthly so we will see which is better.",4
I like the Kindle version better on the Kindle verses the book.  You do not have to deal with all of the advertisements.,3
Never ordered this product yet somehow my account was charged....not happy and cannot find a way to get ahold of anyone!!,1
Credit card charged over two months ago and no magazine yet. How about a refund?,1
"If I could download the issue it may be great. But since I can't, it sucks. I want a refund for all magazines bouGht for kindle from amazon",1
Annual renewal as a gift for my father and he enjoys the content.,4

I love this journal. It's the only one I renew.,5
Great Mag. Beautiful layout.,4
Love these,5
Never received gift and magazine folded,1

Lousy not much to read boring.,2
"As such, I am unable to review it.

However, I can review the ship time and I am not pleased with it at all.",1
"The ratio of ads to content is disproportionate.  Although the ads are beautiful, I prefer the articles.  Maybe I am just envious of the beautiful models and gorgeous merchandise.",3
Not good on kindle format,1
This in one of my favorite magazines. You get so much with your subscription. It is so much thicker than many other magazines costing a lot more.,5
Too expensive for little substance,1
"Perhaps it's just me.  I liked it better when it first came out.
Too many ads.",3
Very good magazine that gives explanations and descriptions that are not overly difficult to comprehend for many age levels  . . from adults to childre..,4

Good read !,4
Disappointed. It has changed since I was getting it in the past. Won't renew.,2
Have only received one copy over a few months,1
Too many ads/fillers and not enough good or so many incomplete stories telling you what you've already heard somewhere else.,2
"Unfortunately downloading Vogue takes way too much time, something like 1/2 hour and application crashes often. Not very stable application.",1
I spent so much more just picking this up at the grocery store much better deal to have it mailed to me. I love my Soaps in Depth,5
"This magazine is a gem, filled with great writing. If you still like the feel of a print magazine and love basketball, Basketball Times is a must for you.",5
This IS the best magazine out there,5
"Really like it with first issue.  NOW I hear it is going downsize from 6-4 issues a year, bummer",3
"What more can you expect for Reader's Digest? Love it and always have copies in the library(bathroom). Has everything in it. Humor, true stories and even info on websites",5
This magazine has been the most helpful for me  in my writing career. I love the helpful articles it holds.,5
June issue teaching tweens how to have anal sex!  Definitely not appropriate for young teens.,1
It's been going downhill over the past year.,3
I love this magazine my boyfriend and i love hiking and camping and there are recipes and ideas that we love when is comes in!!,5
I have had this subscription for 10 years now and will continue to be a loyal customer...this is by far my favorite magazine,5
The cost of a two month for $150 and only mon - fri is crazy. I will not be reordering this paper again. What a rip off,1
i have not recieved a copy yet am looking forward to see it when and i it finally shows up,1
It always has a couple of practical recipes. I wish there were more variety; the realistic kitchen isn't healthy 365 days a year. A couple of the stories were interesting.,4
"Yes, it met my expectations and I have renewed my subscription. It is the best magazine on spiritual traditions.
Thank you
Patricia Roberts",5
I've always loved Readers digest. I'm glad I've got a new subscription.,5
"I marked it one star as I had to mark it at something.  I am having issues with my iPAD and unable to get the subscription app, so I canceled the subscription.",1
Don't care for the magazine at this time.,1
Canceled... not enough to keep me interested,2
It's a favorite past time of mine to learn as much as I can about both World Wars. Check it out.,5
Four months.  Still no issue.  Cancelled this today.  Ridiculous.,1
"A waste of the paper it is printed on. The magazine, I had hoped to get healthy health tips from, was chalked full of pharmaceutical ads",1
This mag needs a new editor. I haven't seen anything interesting in Better Homes for six months. Maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests.,1
"The magazine is fine when I can get it to work, the problem is that it keeps closing on me so I never get to read it.",3
"Same crap inside every month and the fashion stinks. The products are all too expensive. There's nothing new inside, no new hairstyles, makeups, techniques; all old.",1
Years ago I used to read Readers Digest and its no where as good as it used to be. I have been giving it away to a friend.,3
"This is one of my favorite magazines. I love the shopping and ""splurge vs. steal"" sections.",5
"This is just excerpts from books, not worth it, cancelled it.",1
Disappointing. Too general.,1
Has changed so much. Not for me now,3
Still am waiting on the magazine when I got an email a month ago saying it was being processed and I should get it shortly,1
More adds than articles.  Handyman or expert? Most projects are far beyond most homeowners capabilities and tools at the house,2
"Ordered Nov. 14 & have still not recieved my first isse-1 1/2 months ,are you kidding me. I could see 3 weeks maybe.",1
It's a good car magazine and I got it as a test for myself using the Kindle - what do you mean 3 more words required?.,4
It has been more than 8 weeks since Iplaced my order  and I still have not received my first issue.  Very disappointed in how long it takes to get the subscripton going.,1
"Good mix of fluff and some news.  Not exactly an academic experience, but relaxing.  What can you say about a fluff magazine?  Don't buy for educational reasons.",3
"This magazine is okay. Not in my top 5 but for the price at the time, it was a good read. Glad I got to try it.",3
We love Real Simple.,5
90 % ads. Very little content. Didn't receive the clutch.,2
One of my very favorite magazines!!  I love getting this in hard copy.,5
Very disappointed there aren't many coupons anymore.,2
Love it !!!!,5
Lots of great on useful information and tips.  I always find great things to clip and save from each magazine.,5
"I won't be renewing. Lots of ads and extreme prices. Pretty pics and few good ideas, but will try House Beautiful next time.",3
Husband loves his subscription !!,5
Great magazine for a great price. I read them cover to cover when they come in. So much better then just getting bills and junk mail. It gives me something to look forward too.,4
have loved this magazine since i was child so glad that i could afford it,5
We both love this magazine,5
Seems like a good magazine the recipes weren't what I expected,3
I got the kids edition and only got two of them.,1
OK magazine,3
Two and a half months waiting for first magazine...No customer service access to find out why...they where quick to take my money though!!!,1
Don't like it.,1
Vanity Fairis is misogynistic garbage rag.  Dont waste your money.,1
for some reason it takes forever to get the first copy - still don't have it.,1
The food looks great and is simple to make.  Rachel Ray makes recipes easy for anyone to follow.  And the food............,4
"Not worth it! Husband liked it but in a year susbscription he only got 2 issues, from Feb '17 to Dec '17. For $20 that's a rip off. Don't waste your money.",1
This was a gift for my dad..  It's his favorite magazine.  He has to read it from cover to cover.,5
Good insight into what's going on with science and technology in today's world.,4
I received  the first month then nothing after that,1
A good mag for those contemplating rehabing an old boat but deal mainly with over 25 foot boats which are quite pricey for someone on a 17foot sailboat budget.,4
My 4 year old grandson loves this magazine! He thinks it's cool getting mail addressed to him!,5
Excellent science updates and new information.  I really enjoy it; glad I subscribed.,4
"The magazine uses small font, which is tough reading. Content is OK. Looks more like Vogue with all the advertising.",3
Love the magazine. It has great ideas and tips. It is very helpful and knowledgeable on so many different projects. Thank you Handyman.,5
Best fishing mag ever,5
Brought for 11 yr. old granddaughter and she loves it.,5
Love everything Food Network!,5
"The January issue might be the best yet, but Amazon have forgotten to send it to me so I cannot review it.",1
"Interesting articles, but way too expensive a newsletter.",3
I ordered this subscription in the beginning of December and I have only received 1 issue,1
Got charge higher for a year's subscription here than in their own website. EW will give you 2 years for 1 year here... [...],1
Very good magazine with decent reading materials.,4
Really good articles and the best part is that they usually have coupons in them so it's like getting the magazine for free if you use the coupons.,4
Got October's issue in November,3
"I love this magazine! If you are a traveler, you'll love it too.",5
"Disappointed with the magazine, not how I remembered it from a couple years ago, not enough articles, too much filler.",2
This magazine has gone down hill quickly. The writing is terrible and the journalistic quality is nonexistent.,1
"Kind of blah this month, hope it gets better...",3
My son loves this,5
"I have bought and read this publication for 38 years,  it's a must read. Excellent, exceptional and the kindle version is phenomenal.",5
I've been reading Vanity Fair for 20 years and I think it's the best magazine out there.,5
Worst Mag. ever. Goes on an on for several issues about the Doctors of Dallas. That doesn't tell me about Dallas.,1
"been going downhill for 20+ years, now just a waste of trees",1
Nothing but stupid ads and stinky articles.,1
50-60% advertisements. I guess that is why it only costs $5 a year...,1
Been a subscriber for a long time and it is one of my favorite magazines.  Lots of information that can be used and great recipes.  It's an easy read.,5
"It's alright gossip for the price, but I wouldn't spend money on it regularly. This are fun for killing time.",3
She seems to enjoy it very much. I think it's very appropriate for 9 yr old child. She found it very interesting. Opened up conversation for us.,4
I love getting this again !!! I love the stories and beautiful pictures,5
seems like there is ore ads than recipes and most of the recipes are stuff don't normally have around the house and i not comfortable cooking with since i normally don't use them,2
Not coherent takes forever to get through and waste waste waste waste waste I rather have physical mag with me on my trips than digital,1
"I like some of the articles, but I don't plan on renewing it, since I don't get as much out of it to renew.",3
"otherwise I wouldhave not ordered it, it is pretty much ads ads ads and not much else - what are you gonna do lol",1
This was a great deal.  I was very lucky that I found it.  TV Guide is my favorite magazine.  Thank you!,5
"I'm wondering if the 5 star reviews are paid reviews. This is a useless magazine, not in anyway related to mechanics or its science. Advertisements on alternative pages.",1
"Ordered back in November 13 2015  - says 4-6 weeks on the details page.  as of this date, no magazine.  Not good.",1
Where is the notification or magazine< It has been almost 2 months in 2 days?,1
"This magazine is more editorial and product featuring than I wanted. It was cheap though so I took a chance, I still read it for fun.",3
Amazing magazine- thanks to all producing this.,5
Thought I would receive paper magazines but I suppose it's only digital.,1
An inexpensive and convenient way to read the TV Guide.,4
uplifting stories about angel encounters that will make you feel good everytime you read them.,4
Not the issue shown didn't want this one and no way to return :(,1

"It is hard to review a magazine that I have yet to receive even though it was order 12/04/2005.  Please let me know when I can expect to receive my 1st issue,",1
What is there to say?  Outstanding price.  Great publication.,5
I wouldn't waste my time on this hate fill magazine,1
Magazine is very boring.  Too many advertisements and not enough articles.,2
I am very disappointed about the last issue. I read Asimonv's with my kindle. This issue was printed  in such a way that you have to move back and forth for every line.,1
Send you old outdated copies,1
It's a pretty good magazine.  And I am happy I'm getting to try it for free.,4
Hoped for fashion magazine for older women.  This is not.  Will  not renew,2

One of the best sources of Naval History. Their articles are easy to read and are enjoyable. The authors know the subject inside and out.,4
Solid magazine.,4
Love this magazine not only for the decor but also for the recipes. We live at the Jersey Shore and a friend recommended this magazine.,4
"Very disappointed with the last few issues, looks more like UK magazine's. Needs more top shelf designers. Loved it before not so much anymore.",2

"Great magazine, been subscripted to it for years!!!!",5
Not sure when they are coming and when they aren't,3
When they switched from the old app I can't access any of the back issues I  was saving. Go back to the old app or fix this one.,1
"The magazines are invisible after the first two months. What a scam! And when you complain, no one responds! And then they tell you that you can't post a review!",1
Some of my digital edition is missing in my kindle. I can't seem to get it in my iPad.,2
So-so in content.,3
I have not received this magazine yet.  I ordered it June 17.  I can't believe it takes so long to start receiving it.,1

National Geographic Traveler is way better",5
"Fun, educational and she loves her own magazine through the mail :)",5
"This is a relaxing journal to read -- not complex, easy to enjoy, but not a fantastically helpful horticultural experience.",4
My customers love this magazine and the gossip that comes with it. And it's a great price too! They go into withdrawals if I forget to get the lastest issues!,5
I love this magazine!  Every recipe I have tried so far has been absolutely delish!,5
Lame. Inundated with advertising.,1
I subscribed to Time because Newsweek went all digital. This is a good buy for those who still like to read...on paper.,4
Magazine not what I expected to be.,2
A little too homey for me. I only cook for one and this is more for a family person.,3
Good magazine on handguns.,4
"Until this supports the more common - and better - e-ink Kindle, I won't buy it.

I find it very annoying that Amazon doesn't disclose clearly on the site.",1

I found this mag a bit over my head and very technical. Although I WAS able to get some things out of it from reading the issues received.,3

Nkit what I thought. More for racing or touring.,3

I couldn't find what is a news around the world & US for now.",3
Didn't find it very informative.,2
We have been getting this mag for some time now and have learned so much that we did the Bourbon Tour in KY this may.  Learn and enjoy this very special very American beverage!,5
Garbage print. Wouldnt know the truth if it jumped up and bit them on the Ass.,1
Great pulp.  Get a better price by joining AOPA.  $24 for 12 issues.,4
I have not recieved this magazine although I have recieved others that I subscribed to at the same time.,1
This is a typical magazine for houses that are perpetually clean and with perfect decorating.  I can't relate to that at all.,3
"Lots of good tips, worth the subscription",4
DO NOT ORDER DOES NOT WORK AT ALL AND AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT HELPFUL.,1
I like the content and is very easy to navigate through the electronic version.  I would recommend rides to anyone.,4
Insightful information but a little too many advertisements,3
"The mag was good, but a lot of times they just drag way to long a such a little subject.",3
I enjoy reading the Readers Digest from front to back .,4
Glad I looked at the free copy because it didn't fit the Fire screen and was even a little blurry.,1
Why does it take so long to receive this magazine? How can I review this service when I have not received it? Daaaa,1

Great price for a quality magazine.,5

A favorite magazine for 45 years.,5
This is the best soap opera magazine that I've seen.  A must-have for soap lovers like me!  :),5
Just not into magazines too many ads. But great price.,2
I think magazine these days just have too many advertizements and so few other content to look at.  The ads in this magazine have too many also.,3
2 issues? i don't think it was worth it,1
This was an excellent gift!,5
"This will only allow you to view 2 magazines at a time on your device, the rest are stored in the cloud....the app was better....",3
This is an opinion magazine full of largely unreferenced wordy statements and conclusions.,1

I have read this in hard copy for many years and will continue to read F&SF on Kindle! Love it!,5

Transformation Magazine is nourishment for your soul. Connecting with kindred spirits and meditating on positive outcomes is a priority for me. Transformation bridges the gap.,4
Definitely geared towards the softer sided/trendy type of hobby farmer but still has some useful articles and fun reads.  Helps pass a rainy day.  Lots of fall out ad cards.,4
Ordered this mid december and it is now February 3rd and I still have not recieved my magazine.,1

I love Dr. Oz this magazine is great!,5
Lots of learning opportunities for any age reader.  I do not approve of some of the ads for young readers in our school library.,4
"Too full of ads and not enough well written, relevant articles.",2
Probably a very good magazine but I misjudged the age group that it is targeting.  My 12 year old doesn't really find it helpful or engaging.,3
Not sure if its because it was delivered online via Kindle but there were a lot of advertisements and it lacked good articles to read.,3
The New Yorker is an amazing publication.  I've read it for years.,5

I love this magazine! The recipes are the best! My family never knows what's for dinner because we never have the same thing.,5
The program listings for the PBS channel to NOT coincide with our local PBS channel here in the Northwest. So it's a waste of money for us.,1

So far I've received only the digital copy on my Kindle.  No printed copy.  I expected to see one quite a while ago.  Hope it shows up one of these days.",1

Love the format and easy navigation.  Took a while to download on the ipad though.  Always a good read better on the ipad,4
The bag is awful. The magazine is wonderful. The articles and photography are first rate. The bag is an awful shape and awkward to use. A tote would have been better.,1
Articles you wouldn't expect to see in a magazine associated with technology. Off beat and well researched.,5
"wife is glad her subscription started again, i am glad of the price",4
I just clicked on the free issue and without my consent Amazon took money for the whole year. There is no way you can desubscibe.,1
This magazine does not serve the average income family.,1
We had subscribed for this magazine ( 9 issues in 12 months) in Jan 2017. So far ( August 2017) we have only received 2 issues.,1

"Love this magazine, great reviews, articles, etc...",5
The best magazine on the market.,5

3 MONTHS to receive first issue? ?!!??? C'mon  :(,1
If you have gluten issues this book helps,4
National Geographic continues to be the best magazine out there.  The photography and stories are top notch and the topics and locations fastinating.,5

I give this as a gift every year for my grandmother and she loves it!! Great articles and perfect for people with trouble seeing.,5
It's a lifestyle magazine not fashion. I do not need to see two guys making out or a nude woman to learn fashion trends. No content just ads.,1

The magazine did not address the type of garment crafting that I am interested in.  Nor any of the other crafting that I am interested in.,1
I've enjoyed my new subscription to Philosophy Now on Kindle - an ideal way to access this magazine for an Antipodean!,4
The navigation features are archaic. You should be able to view the different sections and their content more easily.  The android app is much better in that regard.,3
Only received three issues .,1

this magazine is just a waste of paper...i guess i am not shallow enough and dumb enough to fall into this high expensive fashion stuff......,1
Not very good.,1
Too hard to read on a Kindle.,2
My daughter asks for this magazine time and time again.  She loves the current info on her favorite stars and the pictures are the tops.,4
I find summer holidays hard to get as excited about as other times of the year so this was fine but I'm hoping the other issues have a little more.,3

"Always loved SOUTHERN LIVING, even gave a subscription to my Daughter for years.....then the price went out of sight.....the offer I got on Amazon was well worth ordering again.",4
"Consistently good articles, notes, fiction, and reviews. I love this magazine!",5
Save your money and go on the National Geographic site and get the same 12 months for $12.00.,1
Not the popular science I remembered from from 40 years ago. Just a collection of news articles that you can easily get from online news.,2

An awful thing.  Marie Claire came to me unsolicited.  Can't wait to get it cancelled and out of my house.,1
Just got my Kindle Fire and this is the first magazine I ordered. I am very excited to have a great magazine at my fingertips.,4
Enjoy reading this but it is skewed towards men.,4
"Extremely similar to GQ, same publisher. You aren't going to get anything from this magazine that you don't get from GQ. Similar to GQ, lots of ads and minimal content.",1
"Just using the printed issues - the old fashioned way. Followed the intructions clearly and it would not work.  Also, Vogue is just not as good as it used to be 1980-2000.",2
Ordered for my wife for Christmas. She enjoys Sudoku. It was a good gift.,4
Their published facts and figures are usually wrong.  Even when I contacted them with the proper data they just ignored me.  It is not a reputable magazine in my opinion.,1
Excellent!!,5
The subscription his news stands tuesday and i receive it on friday some Saturday. Not good for me.  It would be good to receive it wednesday at tbursday the latest.,3
I like recipe magizine,4
Love this magazine and it's so much more convenient on my kindle! It works perfectly and I never have any issues!,5
It is an enjoyable magazine and I will always renew but it s not the best cooking magazine I subscribe to,4
"The content is GREAT, but having a great deal of difficulty getting online access since I don't own a Kindle.",3
"Super fast shipping! Great product, price and seller!",5
Did not find it worthwhile,1
"Do not recieve the magazine. Magazine does not show up, on-line nor in the mail. Do not get it, period",1
This is the best magazine out there!  Awesome content and I love the digital version !,5
This was a great deal.  I purchased the magazine subscription around Thanksgiving and the first copy was delivered before Christmas.,5
"Again, this was a gift and I have heard that the girls liked it a lot.  I have not
looked at it myself but I believe it must be good because these kids have
everything!",4
Too much ads,3
Very inane magazine. Only purchased to fulfill a requirement. Very little real content. Just really not my kind of reading.,1
This is a good magazine.  My only problem is that  some of the print is small and the ink is very light which makes it difficult  reading for someone with vision problems.,4
This is one of the best publications on the study of ancient Egypt. This is the best way to keep on the latest discoveries.,5
Wish it was interactive. Small print hard to read,1
i love this magazine! i learn something new every month. so many interesting subjects. if you like trivia and want to continue learning ... read one issue. you'll be hooked.,5
"I could not tell you about the magazine, my wife has yet to receive anything I have paid for.

I am guessing it's ""Heinrich Bauer North America"" fault...",1
this magazine is not as good as it used to be,3
"What a great magazine! The illustrations are easier to follow than photos, the recipes are great. Love it!",5
My best friend's best ever gift..so good I renewed for another birthday!!!,5
"I like the magazine, i just didn't got it on the mail... I paid for this 2 year teen vogue issues and got 5 of them (2 of them were repeated). Not happy.",1
This was a good cycle magazine at one time.  Now it has way to many ads and little content.  There are better magazines out there.,3
"Everybody knows this is one of the must-have magazine subscriptions if you care about culture, wildlife, or the environment. I read them all cover-to-cover.",5
"Plenty of art work but effort should be spent on real ""news' not entertainment. Much better than issue about top 100",3
wanted magazine not computer reports,1
"They should wrap these in plastic because the magazine isn't thick, so everytime my niece gets one it looks like beat up and the pages are torn etc.",3
The kindle issue takes 2 weeks longer to download then the paper issue. Hope its corrected soon. I am about to cancel my subscription.,1
It is wonderful but I don't have time to read it.,3
Magazine arrived great. However the red bag zippered pocket ripped after first use and the internet download never could connect or download.,2
"I WOULD NEVER ORDER THIS AGAIN. TOO MANY ADVERTISEMENTS. ABOUT 90% ADVERTISEMENTS, AND 10% SO SO RECIPES.",1
"Great tips on saving money, but not so many coupons (there was only 5-7 coupons)",3
I've had a subscription since 2000. Love this magazine.,5
A bit upscale for my budget.,3
best magazine on the planet,5
"Four months after sale and still not the first issue. My subscription must be in limbo-land,",1
"Always some nice photo shoots, though they tend to go back to grungy a bit often for my taste these days.",3
"Got this as a gift for my Dad, who is a Western History buff and he loves it.  Money well spent!",5
Can only get digital on I pad. I have a nook that uses google play and my cell is android. Can't get on either.,1
One of my favorite cooking magazines.,5
"I take my issues to the doctor's office for others to read. I am sure that there are many costs involved in publishing a magazine, but there are just to many ads in the magazine.",3
I guess cooking light means cooking yuk.  I haven't found one recipe in months that I would even bother to make.  Frankly they can't stop send this magazine soon enough.,1
"As of January 31st, I have not received any issues of the Real Simple magazine.  At this point I cannot rate it.  I had to put in a star to proceed with rating.",1
Always consistent and reliable! This is my go to place to find new books to read! I only choose NY times books.,5
Awesome how-to and DIY tips. Cool innovations going on. Great writers and pictures. One of the most interesting magazines out there. Definitely recommended.,5
never ordered,1
No longer good publication.  And look at the vulgar cover depicting Trump. . . no class,1
I think it helps people on tight budges.  It is simple reading and lets you know where to get the products.,4
I only received one issue!!!!!!!! Then received a bill to renew!! Not Happy!!,1
"I would like to give you a review of this magazine, but I ordered it July 13, 2008, and am told I will not receive it until NOVEMBER 2008!",1

It has a little of everything. Love the crossword puzzles.,5
Great magazine for girls. Content is age appropriate.,4
Excellent Magazine...,5
"When I first got an email telling me my auto-renewal was ready, it said the price would be $8. But when I committed, it said the price was $12. Kindof a ripoff.",1
"very liberal, does not hold tradition in a high regard. Jesus is NOT female!!!!",1
best truck mag ever has test's how to 's and tech info!! Love the new gear up and coming new rides.preowned rides and new accessories,5
Nasty publication.,1

good price,4
"Not so good compared to Mother Earth News, Farm Journal and other simular type reading.",2
I was deceived with the subscription as I received only one copy initially and didn't receive the second one or later on. I have provided one star as I received one copy.,1

Got SOAKED with add-on billings. A scam,1
Ordered in March and have yet to see a single issue.,1
Mistake.  Not for me.,1
I found this magazine to be a total waste of my money. I gave it 1 star because there was no way to leave NO stars!!!,1
Love chicks are so hot!!!! Plus the articals are hip and coincide with my generation I've been long time reader since I could and think I always will be,5
This was totally inappropriate for a young teenager. Articles about sex and female masturbation.,1
"I have gotten every other magazine that I subscribed to except Fast Company
What's up?",1
"We moved away from New England a few years ago, and I subscribed to get my fill of NE! I'm quite pleased with the quality of this publication.",5

"Love National Geographic.  Can't be without it.  Well written, interesting articles, beautiful photography.",5
"Wonderful magazine!  These are keepers, which makes it a good deal whatever the price, but at this price, it's a gift giver too!",4

Never could get subscription information corrected.,1

Warning! Kindle Fire won't bookmark your page and remember where you stopped reading. Returns to page one when you return to magazine. Makes this mag close to useless.,1

Adventures section is actually PAID advertisements camouflaged as good tips. :-( and not reliable.,3
"We love wildlife and want to know what kind they have here in AZ.  Very informative, his aunt apparently subscribe to the same magazine.",4
I like the variety in each issue. From at home to international.  Also articles that challenge at times. I love the readers photo section.,5
Definitely one of my favorite magazines.,5
"Yes, it's a great magazine.",4
"Content just ok, will not be re ordering",3
My son was thrilled with his first magazine and we look forward to next month's delivery.,4
"I think it's geared more for the younger generation!  If you're in your twenties or thirties, it woud be great!",3
"It's okay, but I'm a little out of the age range it is trying to reach.",3
Ordered this for my wife.  She loves it.  It has all the factual information without get to far of the titled subject.,5
All is as expected.,3
The magazine frequently has useful information.  Good for the price.,4
"The three column layout stinks and it only serves to add fluff. None of the articles are memorable, and they are pretty shallow. They need more substance in the articles.",2
Love this magazine! Never disappoints!,5
"Great for all that is home, decorating, gardening, cooking and many tips about everything. I love this magazine for it brilliant photos.",5
Quick read. Varied subjects and informative. Easy read!,4
I ordered MORE magazine and ended up getting Better Homes & Gardens. Waste.,1

Did not. Open.,1

Fairly good reads.,4
Fantastic photography. Some good gardening advice.,4
received tote - nice --- but NEVER received any magazines!!!,1
Terrible content. I got this to help me with reading material and ideas for my wood workshop and it has next to ZERO wood working related articles.,1
All it is is advertizing.,1
this magazine I sent as gift and she liked it.,4
Love the ease of automatic renewal.,4
"This price is not just ridiculous it's offensive...  It's ""The Economist"", shouldn't they understand price points a little better than this?!?!",1
Product was incomplete,1
I have received one issue of this magazine and like it so far.  The casual style of the decorating appeals to me.  I am enjoying the articles also.,4
"It's a Highlights magazine, they are perfect. The kids love to read the stories and solve the puzzles. This is something I consider an investment, and I am happy I made it.",5
Didnt much like the magazine.. Wish it was a different magazine,3

"I ordered this magazine 11/28/09 and still have not received the magazine. what is the problem, do i need to cut down the trees myself????????????????",1
Articles have gotten worse over the years. Can toss half the articles due to boring writers.,1
Retains the flavor of old time hunting with a delivery time of 3 to 4 months for first issue.,4
"Unfortunately, I haven't received my first copy of All You magazine so I cannot review it. When will I receive my first issue?",1
Dishonest!,1
April is a long time to wait.subscription is a Christmas present for my 8 year old son,4
"Probably is a good stuff for people who knows the art of crochet; but , it did not feel the expectations of my wife. For entertaiment of beginners is not a good guide.",3

informmative quick reading,4
Not much that really interested me.,3
I have been a subscriber for years and have found the magazine to be less interesting over time. Too bad because the magazines use to be such an interesting collection of essays.,2
I bought this for my kids but quickly cancelled after seeing all the tobacco ads.,1
There were way too many pages of advertisements.  So dissapointed:(,2
dont assume you are purchasing current weeks publication when buying a single issue. theres no way to check cover until its downloaded on your kindle and have paid for it.,1
"Cheaper subscription rate even on the ""official"" New Yorker  website.",1
"By far my favorite magazine! The articles are detailed and interesting. I always learn something new. And, Amazon has the best price.",5
The digital version is only available on iPhone and iPad.,1
Having this publication on my Kindle is great.  I started reading RD at my aunt's when I was 9 and still love to browse the magazine.  I can do that now anyplace that has WiFi.,5
Must be 60% Ads,1
"Wired is a quality magazine with great production standards. However, its hard to say it is any better than keeping up with your news online.",4
Did not like this magazine at all.  The print is so small it was difficult to read even with my reading glasses.  Not as good as it used to be.,2
Not impressed at all. Their quality has plummeted dramatically over the years.,1
I only got 2 of the 6 magazine that I was supposed to get.  Unreliable!,1
"Great magazine, lots of ideas and comments about everyday matters.  The recipes are simple which is a help for non original cooks like me.",4
I have the first magazine and was a little disappointed in it.  Won't renew it,3
"Can't review the magazine because it continually crashes when I try to open it. Payment went through fine, customer service rep was pleasant but I cannot read my purchase.",1
Wonderful to read on my Kindle.  It is a great convenience while waiting in a waiting room.,5
love this magazine!,5

Only 4 stars because I hated the last issue.  I like Wired Mag.,4
"This is one of my favorite cooking magazines. The articles are engaging and the photography is beautiful. I'm always joking with my husband that they're my ""dirty"" magazines.",5
I have been a subscriber in the past and decided to give the magazine another try!!  So glad I did!!!,4
LOVE THS SOUTH AND THIS MAGAZINE!,5
Great mag and articles!!!!,4
Ordered this for my mother who has trouble reading fine print magazines.  She loves the larger print and looks forward to receiving it every month.,5
This is the best Entertainment magazine out there!  I have been a subscriber for many years now.  Get your copy today!,5
reading a magazine on the ipad or kindle is a little strange for me.  i'll keep trying it but I think I'd prefer the real magazine.,3
What I hate is that I NEVER GOT IT!  I am sure I would be satisfied if/when it shows up!,1
"The online magazine is very easy to read.  The articles are always interesting, and diversified.  I would highly recommend this format.",5
Politically biased and unthruthful publishment. A pathetic escuse for journalism.,1
"Love this magazine!  Easy patterns for not-so-talented and experienced knitters with clear directions and lots of beautiful pictures.  Also, adds are relevant to yarn crafts.",5
I love this magazine and I am so thankful I can get it through Amazon.,5
Got my free scarf but the app never downloaded into my kindle.,1
Pay for ads..wtf,1
"All ads, not too many articles. The colors are great and the ads are nice but I don't want to pay for the extremely small content in this magazine.",3
One of my all-time favorite magazines with great article and wonderful recipes.,5
The smart phone format is too small. Can't read half the articles. If they switched to a kindle format ( I love my Atlantic Monthly on smart phone) then I might stay with it.,1
mom loves it..,5
Outstanding magazine.,5
to me Glamour is more of a young crowd targeted magazine. Liked its relationship columns or whatever you call it.,3
Great I love this publication. Excellent writing.,5
"It did take a little while to get to me, but still happy with the experience.",4
Didn't order.  Fire was hacked.,1
Isn't the same old Time. But still pretty good.,4
I have only received one tv guide!,1
Renewed through AMAZON. The clutch is great!!! Can't live without Vogue. Have been receiving it for five years.,5
Magazine would be more enjoyable to read if you  could just pick it up and skim through it without having to hunt up the bifocals.,3
"I have been a longtime subscriber and the print version usually takes forever to get to me.
Its nice having the kindle version for that reason!",4
I am VERY disappointed with this magazine. The content is weak & the fashion pages are certainly not aimed toward the every-day woman. It's weird & poorly done.,1
Beautiful magazine.  So true of the good ole South!,5
Good magazine but subscription prices are expensive and it never seem to go on sale.  Aren't they supported by ads like every other magazine?,3
"Maybe I'm too low class or something.  I just don't get it.  Boring.  I tried it, it failed.  Give me sports, news, entertainment.  This doesn't really have any of that.",1
Love Yoga Journal and love that I can have it auto-renewed through Amazon and I never miss a magazine.  Great product and great service.,5
The fact that it was in black and white was a disappointment,1
The magazine is out control,1
I don't like it because it has. Only prime time and no daytime guide. I like having all daytime also.,1
This is a great magazine. I live that they stand behind their product reviews! I trust them.,5
Not the best issue.,2
Best golfing magazine out there. Great price.,5
So sad this magazine has shifted from gorgeous editorials showcasing really top-end interiors to what seem to be paid advertorials.  Really a shame.,3
Reading this magazine for years enjoy the short articles and useful hints,4
"Best magazine out there for its kind, truly a keeper in so many ways!!",5
This one is a big hit with both MOM and DAUGHTER (age 11)  She loves it!  I love it!  SCORE!!!!,5
"Not a bad publication, but it really is mostly ads. Some insightful articles and the industry focus editions can be interesting, but for the most part, not worth it.",3
Wish they would focus on old trains and not rhe new electronic stuff. It was much better when it first came out.,3
"This is perhaps my favorite magazine of this type. Interesting, beautiful homes in each issue with inspiring photos to boot!",5
"Was interesting but seemed to have a lot of ads.
Maybe I am just not part of the magazine generation.

Did have some interesting beers to look for though!",3
Ok I guess. A little too liberal for my liking...,3
Favorite magazine.,5
Did not care for the stories and some of the paragraphs and punctuations were incorrect.  Just not my type of reading.,2
"Not what I was hoping for, only one recipe looked like I would give a try.",1
"Now I know why Oprah has so much money! All the advertisements in her magazines! It is literally flooded, and it's hard to find the next article.",1
I didn't know it would take four months before my subscription would start.,1
I.love this magazine.  Do.much great info!,5
Scammed into buying these,1
Got this for my niece for Christmas and she really loved getting something new to read in the mail. The only down side was that it took 8 weeks for it to start getting to her.,4
not much inside,2
Have been trying to download this since i ordered it and it will not work very frustrated.  Still waiting on help,1
"I find it a nice little read, but most of the recipes require so many off the wall (not in your average pantry) ingredients they will never get made.",3
"I meant to order Southern Lady, not Southern Lady Classic. This has pretty pictures but that is all. I will not renew.",3
My daughter LOVES this magazine and asks every.single.day. if a new issue has arrived.  I wish it came more often.  Great magazine for little girls.  :),5
Fast Shipping Great,5
Great magazine! Glad to finally subscribe...,5
"Cover stories weight thin in quality, waaaaay to many ads!",3
Mag has nothing but glorified ads. You'll get more info from your neighbors kid than from this promotional tag. Seriously!!!,1
Could never figure out how to get it on my device since it doesn't work on the kindle app. Also paper copy is lame and thin,1
This magazine is FANTASTIC!  The recipes are great...beautifully photographed...a family favorite!  My husband looks through and selects new recipes he wants us to try.,5
"As of the 4th of July, 2012, I have not recieved any issues of this magazine. I will galdly review once I start receiving them.",1
The handyman mag is one of the best I have ever read anybody that likes to build things or even repair this mag is for the serious. Do it yourselfer!  G mclain. Ohio,5
"A great magazine at a fantastic price, what's not to love!",5
Oprah was a $5.00 magazine for one year so it was hard to pass up. Perhaps a 3.5 to 4 stars may have been better. But quite frankly I purchased it for the great price.,3
I'd like to see it a little more interactive like other magazines other wise it is a good leisure read.,4
Can't get rid of them  worst than Facebook to cancelling.....,1
"The magazine is okay, but I'm not impressed.",3
I think I got a magazine that is for the computer to read not  a real magazine.. totally disappointed!!!!!!!!!,1
I have been a subscriber for nearly 20 years. Love my EW!!! Look forward to opening my mail each week!,5

So many in fact, you won't be able to tell what's written by the Magazine and what's an ad.",2
Still awaiting for my paper copy,1

Good overall magazine.  Some helpful articles. I do look forward to reading it every month.,4
The price was right and it was my first magazine for my tablet. Still learning,4

"this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time.  if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator, readsomething else.",5
I love the digital subscription. Now I can stay up to date on my musical interest's,5

I ordered my subscription back in Nov and still waiting for my first issue.  Very disapointed.,1
"It was a Christmas gift to my sister, she enjoyed.",4
Not as much information as others I have purchased in store,3
"I grew up with National Geographic and have always loved it! Whats not to love? Beautiful pictures, informative, educational articles and just a class act all the way around.",5
Not my thing.  Sorry,1
Nothing to it.  Just an advertisement.  Little article content.,1
Southern Living has been one of my most favorite magazines for years!,5
"The Kindle edition is much more expensive than the print edition....and does not have the charts, pictures etc. Hope TIME is rethinking soon.",3
Great diabetes info...but price is a bit much!,3
0 stars.  As of the last March issue playboy is now a no nudity magazine.  They also removed the good jokes and comics.  Its now worthless.  Canceling my 10 year subscription.,1
"Great price for a wonderful magazine. You can not go wrong. Arrived before it was supposed to, so even better.",5
"I tried contacting them about no magazine being rceived, but there was no response.  They never sent me anything, They just kept my money.  Bob Benson",1
"I have received the kindle version, but as of 3/23/14, have not received the print version.  Great issue on Kindle!",1
I used to get magazine before. So far the first issue seems to have a lot less content than before. We will see what comes in the future.,3
"I love the magazine because I'm a watch collector. The item was priced right, arrived in a timely manner and the shipping costs were great. Thank You.",5
Not at all what I expected,2
"This is one of the best food magazines we have seen.
We look forward to every issue and save them for valuable recipes
and cooking instructions.",5
my sister loves this magazine,5
One of the most important magazines you could ever own. So useful and insightful. Love it.,5
Has some great up to date information.,4
Great articles and gear review.,4
There seem to be too many adds but the articles are fantastic.,3
I think I'm getting overwhelmed with things I should be cooking. Not a bad choice.,3
Issues have been pretty bad. Last one was deplorable. Just a lead up to their 10 best issue.  No in depth reviews.,1
printing is too small.,2
Interesting stories and diversions when your time is limited,4
"I have been a subscriber to this very inspirational book.

I recommend it for all Catholics and all Christians in general.",5
"A little less adverts would be great! Appreciate the ""focus"" of the mag has much variety!",4

very poorly written with little content. Not worth the time or money.,1
very anti God publication,2
"Love national geographic. Pictures are great, articles intriguing, and buying it on Amazon was the best deal I could find.",5
Too liberal sometimes,3
The magazine's ok - in the digital age I wonder how relevant it is. But for a synopsis it's a great weekly magazine that will give you some interesting stories and reviews.,3
Always worth reading!,4
"I love this magazine and read every word printed in it.  I'm a regular reader of it, just don't screw up and miss an issue!!",5

Nothing but advertisements.,1
"Love this magazine.  If you like heat in your menu, subscribe.  Great recipes.",5
My brief reading  was that it did not hit the mark on the article  which I read,1
I just re-ordered this magazine. It can be repetitive like any fitness mag but it keeps me motivated to hit the gym and that's all I care about.,3
I would love to review this; however I haven't received my first issue yet and am kinda disgusted that it has taken so long for it to come.,1
Great sports magazine that's on my 9 year olds level!,4
Very good for beginners like me.,4
This is my favorite magazine.  It leads you to all sorts of weekend adventures or long vacations close enough to drive to.,5
a perfect read for beginners & regulars to the gym..... motivates self... creates desire to look better.... road map to a healthy lifestyle..,4
"Have only received two issues to date.  Use of non-familiar, unavailable in my area ingredients.",1
Not nearly as good as the print version. Was very disappointed.,2
repetitive recipes,2
Two many adds.,3
"Some tips, a useful article here and there, but then, do you really need it?  Just a bit less tree in the world, and how is that very zen?",3

Not as good as I remembered.,3
"I've been reading this magazine since 1970! It's just as good electronically as on paper so far, so no complaiaints. It's still the best overall guitar magazine that I know of.",5
girls love it,5
Kinda boring.,2
Everyone should get a subscription and a hat which I love,5
My 88 year old Mother loves this!!! One of my best gift purchases ever : ),5
Excellent review / reading of upcoming TV shows! Now we're given the additional benefit of finding the edition on our tablets! Wow!!,5

"I was never able to access the magazine electronically, but did (and do) receive my print edition.",1
I WAS CHARGED FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF ONLINE WHEN IT COMES FREE WITH MY PAID SUBSCRIPTION.  REALLY AGGRAVATES ME.,3

"I have always loved this mag!  It never disappoints.  I love to look at the pictures, and I'm in my 50's :)",5
Recipes with unpronouncable titles and ingredients. It would cost a small fortune to buy all the ingredients and a master chef to cook.,1
"great magazine! Many fun ideas for families! I love the crafts and recipies, and games. Thank you disney for bringing our family together!",5
I love being able to hold the magazine and to have it on my Kindle as well.  Great magazine for artists.,5
Nice magazine with ideas.,4
This was the best price that I found for National Geographic magazine . I've recieved the magazine in my wife's name for years.,5
The mighty days for this publication are now clearly behind them. Get a digital version or read online for free most of the articles. Mostly 5-page weathertech floor mat ads now.,2
Love this magazine!! Love Rachael Ray!!,5
Very good recipes and info.  I like the easy referral chart in the back.  Thanks for a great useful magazine,4
"Great magazine full of great ideas, and DIY guide, a great tool for interior designers!",5
"Same every month. Ok for muscle heads. If you aren't one, pass.",3
One of the best health magazines out there. I find 85% of their articles very interesting. Better than Men's Fitness.,5
"Pictures were fine, print was to small to read on my kindle.",3
Magazine was super thin. Too many ads. Not what it used to be. I canceled immediately.,2
had to cancel,1
"I like this magazine, it has fashion, it has interesting articles, health and fitness, celebrities, it has a little bit of everything.",4
Continually promotes promiscuity in their articles.,1
We enjoy skimming the magazine to get decoration ideas for our house. Some of the ideas presented are interesting! If you are looking for ideas you might enjoy this magazine.,4
"Love it, but they stopped coming after first three issues. ",3
Already being bothered to renew and never got the tote.,1
The magazine is thin more like a pamphlet. Like a pamphlet it has a ton of advertisements in it. I don't bother reading it anymore.,1
"Honestly, it would be ALOT better with the pics and graphs. All I have to say is: GET THE NOOK!",3
I find the fashions terrible and will end my free trial subscription.,1
"I paid for this subscription over 2 months ago and have yet to receive a single issue?? So, I guess I can't tell you what I think about the magazine.",1
Some good articles between all of the glitz and advertisements.,3
Too much advertising!!,3
"I grew up with Outdoor Life and Jack O'Connor, etc.  I didn't realize how it has shrunk over the years. It's quite thin. Fewer pages.",2
Miss-named...should be called Outdoor Death given all the animals shown killed in each issue.,1
Given as gift they loved it,5
I love the pictures and ideas in this magazine.  I've received it for several years now and just love every one.  It speaks to all types of styles and house sizes.,5
Boring. Mostly goofy ads,1
Magazine is made for the ADHD crowd if that is even possible in a magazine.  I think this one will be cancelled quick.,1
I am a new subscriber and a little disappointed with the magazine as a whole.,3
This once great magazine has devolved into a shill for the far left propaganda machine. I will never have this garbage in my home again.,1
Wow such ads in this magazine. A little of every thing. Interesting to see all the things I can't afford,4
"I love this magazine, it has tons of great ideas, tips and tools.  I like it so much I ordered a subscription for my brother.",5
This magazine was very informative.  We have learned a lot from it.  Now we are both Diamond Members with Royal Caribbean and appreciate all the info we received.,5
Kindle part is GREAT! Received 2 issues - Kindle only. Why Have I not been mailed the print issues? Unhappy about this. Today I will need to call the magazine's customer service.,1
This is my absoulte favorite magazine.  I look foward to this every month and read it cover to cover.  Its a must have for any parent.,5
"Aah, I like science but. Magazines are mostly advertisement. NOT ENOUGH SCIENCE.",3
Love this magazine. But I ordered this and on the receipt realized it will take FOUR MONTHS for this magazine to show up. Ridiculous. Too lazy to cancel the order.,1
Alot of advertising,4
Kurt was/is an icon and I had to have this magazine as a fan.  Item came in perfect condition and anyone who is a fan of Nirvana should get themselves a copy of this.,5
absolutely - love it  -- we are able to see all the latest activity in our beautiful universe. Thank You,5
"Great gift for my husband who likes chickens, bees and all things farm.",5
I ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it.,1
Didn't like this.  It was dated and the patterns were old.  It felt like it was something from the 80's.  Not for me.,2
Meh. The articles were pretty lame.,2
Great recipes with clear directions. Plus there are modifications listed which make each recipe extremely versatile. A must-have for the home cook.,5
I've always loved this magazine.  One of the best if not the best.,5
"Ordered as a gift for someone,they like this monthly mag",4
Love this magazine!  I have been getting the paper version delivered for years!  Looking forward to reading it on my Kindle.,5
i cant access my subscription and the links don't work. i uninstalled the app and installed it again with no luck.,1
This product is really awesome !I'm very pleased with this purchase.,5
"I know it said ""The first issue should arrive in 12-16 weeks,"" but I don't understand why it should take so long.",1
I did not like this magazine like I thought I would.  the articles were too advanced and never a consistent theme.  Magazine is too diverse.,2
If only writer's Digest spent as much time creating articles for writers as they did spamming for you to renew your subscription,1
Great articles and beautiful photos. I look forward to the next issue!,4
Not bad. won't renew though.,3
Don't waste your money on this magazine. The photos are nice but this magazine is way over priced. You can find the same information online.,1
length of time for renewal to kick in seems quite long given today's technology.  price isn't as reasonable either since we are paying more than last year.,3
This came a lot faster then they said it would and I love this magazine.,5
Oh how the once mighty have fallen.,1
like this magazine alot. my only request would be more architecture in it. maybe a bit less flowers. keep it up.,3
U cannot enlarge words in digital version  print is way to small to read in magazine  version I wasted my money,1
I love the explanations so simply written.  Pictures help greatly with the how to do part of recipes.  Great assortment of cooking tips!,5
"I wish I had read closer about the number of issues that are given with the subscription. Other than that, it's a good read and very informative.",4
Enjoy the articles.,4
rather flimsy paper and was damaged in mail,1
Has been one of my favorite magazines for years....,5
Best magazine ever. Chockful of information and beautiful pictures.,5
"I was shocked by the amount of propaganda and sophistry in this once libertarian-leaning publication.  If you are looking for free-thought and reason, look elsewhere.",1
i love the magazine.,5
I thought this was a respectable magazine with evidence based articles.  I was completely wrong.,1
Not not as much content as before,3
"Not sure who's reading my Readers Digest, but it's not me. Maybe the mailman is taking it to his house to read.  Needless to say I will not be renewing.",3
"Great magazine, glad I got it again after all these years.",5
Lots of advertisement,3
Good magazine. Lots of healthy eating ideas.,4
"it was okay, just nothing much to it.  I don't know if I'll buy it again soon, may try another magazine instead.",3
Best handloading magazine there is.,5
Mother absolutely loves this magazine and wishes she could move back to AZ,5
I love this book!  All recipes has the easiest to understand and fantastic pictures!,5
Cannot tell you how frustrating it is to pay for a product and not receive it. Hope it gets here soon!,1
Needs more text. This is a bit too much like Popular Science...but without the pictures. Otherwise pretty good. Worth a look.,4
Took a long time to get setup...found a better offer 2 days later...couldn't cancel it so I paid twice as much. Not real happy...but is what it it. Magazine is cool.,3
Got subscription for grandchildren. They seem to like it and appreciate the variety therein.,4
What a waste of time and money,1
This magazine is a shadow of its former self. It used to be informative and interesting now it's just stories about incompetent hipsters.,2
Received as a gift. Very basic. Nothing interesting. Ends up in the trash.,1
Lovely magazine although i was hoping for primitive applique projects.,3
This magazine is okay.  But it's mostly advertising of designer goods to rich people.  Wish I hadn't gotten it.,3
Didn't love it,2
"Given as a gift and much appreciated.  Amazon makes it so easy to renew a subscription and keep the stories coming.  Thank you for great writing, art and delivery.",5
Not my style of magazine.,2
"I love the magazine, but I would love to receive it before I see it on the news stands or at least the same day.",3
Not for my age group 65 plus,2
Good articles to many adds just like all magazines,4
Not a bad read,3
"love this magazine with all the topics and information of the catholic way of life, things that you want to know the answer too.",5
You cannot beat TV guide to know what is on the channels.  Been reading this for over 30 years.,5
"Lots of good stuff in this magazine.  I don't care for the off-the-wall recipes - I like the basics.  In fact, that's what I like about the magazine - is the basic stuff.",4
TIME MAG is great ... but ... I'd prefer a PDF version instead of this interactive one. Or have the choice.,3
This magazine is filled with ads and the articles are rarely very interesting (unless you make millions). Not worth my precious time!,1
"All of a relevant information at this time are inside , love love",5
Poorly organized,1
"No better than it was years ago when I quit subscribing.
Too many ads and not enough articles of interest.
Still pretty poor.",2
I have a purebred yorkshire terrier and this magazine helped me train and show her! Its great! Five stars. Any dog lover will go crazy about this magazine! WOW!,5
Glad to get the publication.  One of my favorites since first reading it in the barber shop.  Articles are timely and interesting,5
The subscription process was easy ant the first issue came earlier than estimated .Price was half of a renewal,4
Pretty good recipes,4
This is like a mini catalog you'd get in the mail from a makeup company than a magazine. Filled with ads. Not happy I spent that kind of money on this junk.,1
They are some interesting articles even though the magazine is very flat.,3
My daughter loves it! Just wish it came every month.,5
Used to be a great magazine. Then they had to insert themselves in to the presidential campaign. Idiots!,1
"My daughter gets 17, and she enjoys its, but I like the Teen Vogue because it is a little less casual and a little classier.  With both publications, she is well balanced.",4
I guess that I thought Readers Digest would follow page by page the published magazine and it didn't.  I found it hard to read and understand the format.,1
"A staple in any man's periodical library.  It should just be issued with the dangly bits at puberty.  Even so, the content has slipped a bit over the years.",3
Fantastic magazine and highly recommend it for all nature photographers just starting out as well as for those with experience.,5
"Bought this as a stocking stuffer.  My husband said he liked some of the articles, but wouldn't buy it again.",3
Vanity Fair has become arrogant and extremely political. I will not renew my subscription.,1
A great read every week.  Never disappointed.,5
Tried 12 times to get them to recognize my subscription and it failed every time! Not worth the effort and a negative to renewing the print mag.,1
Best and only Entertainment magazine worth reading,5
I absolutely LOVE this magazine! Every issue is great!,5
Love this magazine. It is delivered in good shape too!,5
"I love Cosmo magazine, but I ordered it last month and I got a postcard saying I wouldn't get one until July. I am not very happy with that.",1
Love this magazine. Amazon's ability to manage all your magazine subscriptions from their site is a welcome tool.,5
I like the longer articles that go into depth on subjects.  I'm not fond of the little snippets of info near the beginning of the issue.,3
Once in a while there will be an article that interest me. It does have some nice photos though. It's ok,3
Just love this magazine.,5
For a fashion magazine I prefer VOGUE hands down.,3
"Used as 2 subscriptions as 2 baby shower gifts

Its not what it used to be.,2
Awesome!!,5
I love the Wired magazine. Challenging article,5
Ok but not great.,3
Informative and suitable for ages 12 - adult,4

Mostly advertising in the magazine.,3
Always great ......,5
"No I was unable to download vanity fair magazine on my Ipad
I am very disappointed",1
This one is an old favorite and one I find myself saving articles and recipes from all the time. I gave it four stars only because of the intrusive advertising!,4
good read,4
"A lot of advertising,  but equally good content.",4
The best way to start my day.,5
Great magazine lots can be learned from reading it,5
I doubt you will publish my review since I have not received a single copy after several months.  I will be very reluctant to buy again.,1
This magazine stinks.,1
About 50% ads.,1

I haven't received any issues to date,1
love it - all organizations should read this,5
"Magazine is getting smaller, but crafts are always interesting.",4
It was informative,4
Way too many ads.  This is okay just not quite what I was hoping for. Not even sure how to cancel the subscription.,2
Luv it. My favorite interior design magazine currently in print. Even if Metropolitan Home was successfully resusitated (pleeeeeze) I think I would still love Elle Decor.,5
"I buy this yearly for my mother who depends on her TV for much of her entertainment.
I know she really enjoys it and is commenting on many of the articles.",4
I'm a wedding photographer who loves finding new inspiration for my future events. Martha Stewart weddings has some of the best visuals I've seen by far.,5

Thank you

Rita Snyder",1
"Being a ""Gun Nut"" from my early youth I find this magazine has always fulfilled my need to be up-to-date on all things guns.",4
I've been reading this magazine for years and to get a full year for the price of one issue is just great... Thanx Amazon!!!,5
I have always loved Good Housekeeping and am happy with the magazine. But I never received the tote bag which is disappointing.,3
Didn't have a lot of what I wanted and I now have no need for magazines whatsoever. No point in waiting when I can just read what I need online.,1
"Excellent money magazine for all investors, young and old alike.",5
Best! Great project ideas,5
"I ordered three subscriptions from various sources via Amazon.  Two arrived immediately, two months later still waiting on Backpacker.  Seriously?",1
"For the information provided, this magazine is way too expensive. Recording magazine is the best buy.",1
stories and writing is solid but the content per magazine is a bit scant.,3
You may get frustrated with some of the editorials and opinions if you are conservative but the articles about Texas will keep you coming back.,3
This is not a true rating because this magazine was ordered for my grandaughter and has not been recieved yet.,1
My 89 year old mother-in-law loves it!,5
grandson enjoyed,4
"It's advertised as Print + Kindle. However, I am unable to get the Kindle version. Contacting Amazon did not help, as they are unwilling to honor the offer.",1
"Not many recipes my family would eat, but I love the format and it is a pretty magazine to look at,with some good ideas.",4

"Articles are related to mechanics, I used to get years ago, Very disappointed i will not be renewing my subscription.",1
Lousy magazine. Complicated to look at. Does not work well as an ereader. Definitely needs to be revamped into a better format.,1
This journal was one I sent work to in the 70s and I wanted to see what it was like now. I did not receive a single edition.,1
A great price.  Reader's Digest never disappoints. I have been enjoying it for over 30 years.,5
Can not down load till 1 Aug 14,1
"Seriously Popular Mechanics, I am done subscribing, I have been a subscriber for YEARS and it's like 99% ad's these days. Forget it, I am done",1
lots of info Thanks,4
Great recipes that include basic nutritional data so you can easily decide if a dish is right for you. Easy to navigate on Kindle Fire. Tablet bonuses are great.,4
I did like this magazine but each one was pretty much the same and offered little variety.  I guess that's how it is with magazines these days though.,3
I ordered this May 8 and have still not received a copy nor any acknowledgement of the order except from Amazon.,1
"I love this magazine. It is filled with savings, recipes and great ideas. I bought it for a great price",5

"great magazine. my bro loves the articles and the gift. He spends all the time he can in the woods, so this is the perfect magazine for him. yeah!",5
I've never understood why a weekly subscription takes 6-8 weeks to get started. Just doesn't make sense.,1
I've read similar issue articles in other publications.  Very disappointed that writer's opinion is forefront and central to the articles throughout the magazine.,2
my husband loves it.,5
I cancelled the subscripton before it began because i found another offer at half the price.,1
they haven't gotten it yet and it was a gift???? I don't know what the hold up is and I'm getting the run around.,1

"The only thing I could download was the cover. I tried over and over to download more, but it was a fruitless and frustrating experience.",1

"I WAS EXPECTING A MAGAZINE ABOUT CRUISING, INSTEAD I FOUND THAT IT WAS ABOUT SERVICES FOR CRUISE COMPANYS WITH LITTLE TO INTEREST THE AVERAGE CRUISER.",3
I don't like the auto renew.,1
A poor substitute for the image-laden actual magazine.,1

My husband loves this magazine! He is always looking forward to the next issue. I recommend this magazine to everyone who loves trucks / jeeps.,5

"Magazine not what I thought it would be, nor should be. Cannot be easily read  on the Fire. Better luck next time.",1
Thanks for offering such a great deal. I couldn't pass this up. If and when I am close to the end of this subscription I hope I can get this deal again.,5
Way too many ads.  Made it difficult to find articles.  Super heady cologne ads for men's fragrances stayed on hands and clothes.  Found one good article.,2
I love this magazine !,5
Not up to par,1
"Ordered the magazine in August and was told it would not start until December, it better be worth the wait, will not renew script, birthday gift turned Christmas gift.",1

Way too many ads for stuff I really don't care for.  Not enough articles or western US interest material,2
Cancelled. Did not have type of content and interest I recalled from long-term subscription from years ago.,1
This magazine is the best on the market.  Great demos and information for all artists of all mediums.  I would highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed.,5
"I like most of the decorating articles, real people doing real things to their homes.  The rest of the magazine is okay.",3
we have subscribed to this mag for lots of years. my son loves it. lots of interesting articles for our aspiring engineer.,5
But the price is nuts! At least with the print version I can clip articles pass it along and take to my library when I am done.,3
I was not able to open it up on my Kindle. The only articles that came through were the ad pages?,1
Mostly ads and some bad some good poems to read. Found many poems inaccessible. More like a pulisher's ad sheet than a review of poetry.,3
Not happy with the publication,2
It's been over a month since I paid for the subscription and I still haven't seen any sign of a magazine yet.  <sigh>,1
Practically all ads,2

Tried to cancel,1
I really enjoy the magazine.  My only thing is I enjoy reading on my tablet but for this magazine I can't adjust the type so it makes it hard to read.,4
A quick easy pattern source with the newest styles. I can always count on this magazine for easy gifts and stash busters.,4
There were at least 2 months that the magazine did not down load to my kindle. When I cancelled the magazine all of the magazines disappeared off my kindle. Very disappointed.,1
"We love this magazine. It has great DIY ideas, decorating ideas and othe ways to save money and make your home your castle.",5

"It's nice to have this on my kindle where I can look for ideas for eal time envy where. Whether I have y phone .kindle, or ipad",4
Almost all ads.  Waste of $.,1
"It accomplishes its mission to showcase great writers, one story at a time. Each writer is different, and One Story puts a spotlight on the best of the best.",5
I haven't read PM in a few years. Not as good as it use to be. I use to have better content.,3
Apex gives one a glimpse into the exceptional abilities of minds on Sci Fi and Fantasy.,4
Not a Christian magazine by my definition. It's gone down hill.,1

Cancelled it after just one look at it.,1
A few interesting articles I guess.,3
"I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and we both love it! I am very happy with the purchase!",5
After buying item was told would be 3 months before 1st issue.  I won't need it then.  Would never have bought it if I knew I had to wait 3 months,1
Tried a few recipes and they turned out great!,4
"Ripoff!  Will not download, then asks you to subscribe or buy the issue KINDLE UNLIMITED should not list this mag as part of the UNLIMITED  issues.",1
I'm trying to give Woman's Day the benefit of the doubt......too many ads so far...not much reading.  Will have to see what other issues are like.,3
"Magazine is great but not all the on line functions always work. The "" what's on today"" doesn't always scroll through the days!",3
Great humor as always. Grandson loves it.,5
"So full of ads, and poor quality articles and blurbs. Few pages.",1
"I love Oprah, but the magazie seems to be mostly advertisements.  It's not as good as I was hoping",3
Good magazine but it took several months to get the first issue.  They actually sent me renewal notice before we got the first issue.,3
Mit tech review is one of the best glimpses into the future that one can get...excellently researched and written. Awesome!!!,5
wish there was more tattoos to get ideas from,3
I prefer the email newsletter I receive online,3
Works on both seven inch and ten inch tablet (at least for my eyes). Quality of the content varies. Sometimes really great.,4
I like the content but it seems skimpy to me in comparison to the print I used to buy.  I gave it a 3 star because its not as long as the print one I used to buy.,3
Love this magazine.  Lots of beautiful pictures,5
I ordered a subscription for a co-worker as part of our Secret Santa exchange.  She was so excited to get it and has made some of the recipes to share at the office!,5
A wonderful book. Stories are about real people and are true. I have read guidepost for years.,5
I cancelled my subscription.  Google it to find the number. No more cartoons. No more of what I signed up for. What are they thinking?,1
Enjoyed descriptions of places visited. Definitely helps plan trips,4
I have no idea how I ordered this for a whole year. I don't even look at it that much. Do not like it,1
Its not like I remembered.,3
"Got it for my husband who plays the piano and enjoys composing and producing songs on his synthesizer. He loves it, and checks the mail often for the next issue.",5
Delivered as advertised.  VERY Happy!!,5
We always like The Readers Diggest and this was the best deal you could ever find......We are glad we got it......,5

I used to really love this magazine.  It's been dumb downed and I am not a fan.,1
great magazine i have been reading it for years,5
"No magazine has better recipes than this one. RS makes sure their recipes are delicious, nutritious and easy to follow.
I love this magazine and so does my boyfriend.",5
When and if I get this magazine I will be happy to let you know..,1
Haven't seen anything of it yet. If I had know it would take so long I would have rather bought it from a news stand  or book store,1
Took an awful long time to renew,3
Not very interesting.  It is not worth the money,1
"I guess I'm too old but this magazine was too ""Yuppie"" for me",1
I'm not getting these monthly as I had expected.,2
Best design magazine ever.,5
Impossible to cancel online.  A lot of adds in the magazine. Auto renewed.  Save your money!!!!,1

You are not getting fashion trends, good pictures of trends, etc.
Just boring long articles...",2

It has become a go to source for me and my family.",5
"I purchased Popular Mechanic through Amazon and cannot open. I contacted PM and they said to cut off my pop ups, I did but did not help, so I paid for absolutely nothing!!",1
Zero stars if I could. Flipped about 25 pages of ads before magazine even started,1
Great magazine with lots of information.,5
Received on time and my husband enjoys the articles.,4
Awful access and bad customer service,1
Love this mag and gave it to a friend and he loves it too,5
"As usual, one of the best cooking magazines.  Every page, every article is a treat!",5
I have received only ONE magazine since ordering in JUNE!!!!!!  I have written numerous emails to integrated Media and Amazon and NOTHING has been done!!!!,1
"Good magazine, plenty of interesting stuff, up to date info, fashions, fashion tips, health and beauty.
Would recommend.",4
I love this magazine and you can't beat this price.,5
Thought it was going to be more pattern and project ideas. Instead it is full of too much editorials and stories.,3
My 9-year old wasn't too interested as the tips are more advanced than he's interested in.  He didn't want to read all the detail.,3
i orderes this book back in feb and still have not got it yet  it just takes to long to get books from  you all,1
"Awful, just awful. It ads punctuated with stories that scare you into buying goods advertised.",1

"The magazine is being delivered, and I enjoy it, but the Kindle edition never made it. Is it because I have a Kobo tablet?",1
"I got a free copy of the November issue and it states the full one year subscription rate is $19.99, so I don't see how amazon can claim this as a discounted price.",1
I ordered Real Simple on my Kindle and paid for it but it never showed up on my Kindle.,1

I love readers digest I have for years,5

great reading good value,4
I ordered on 11/2/10 and just checked the status because I haven't received it yet.  It won't be delivered until 3/2/11. That is 4 months.  That is is ridiculous!,1
very good photos- limited content spread over huge variety of sports.  Shows difficulty print has in focusing content.  Where do you go after reading the one article on baseball?,3

Got a sub for my birthday. Enjoying it so far. Excellent read.,5
about the size of A NEWS PAPER ANY MORE,2
First magazine I downloaded and I found The Oprah Magazine easy to navigate. Only problem is that the June edition was so-so. Maybe July edition will be better?,3
not too exciting,3
didnt like the format overall...seemed like alot of ads but there isnt...its just how the mag is set up...too many thumbnail pics that are hard to see!,3
It took two months to receive the first magazine and didn't receive any more after that.  Defenitely the last magazine subscription I order from Amazon.,1
So little of this magazine is actually dedicated to tattoos.  Some of the models are attractive but only have a few scratchy tattoos.,3
I love the magazine but even with enlargement feature the layout of some copy makes stories hard to read.,3
I love this magazine. It's full of fashion tips and not cluttered with ads and articles. Straight forward and can't miss.,5
"Like what they are doing for girls. Good information, just not my favorite layout on my tablet. Will keep it to see how it goes.",4
I've always enjoyed reading Redbook and couldn't pass up the opportunity to subscribe at a great rate through Amazon.,4

"I ordered this for my 12 yr old daughter and she loves it, she's always asking when he next one is going to arrive",5
I ordered this subscription out of nostalgy for my late father. When I was a very young fellow I also used to read what I consider was a better version of this popular magazine.,1
Great magazine but only received 2 magazines of a year's subscription,3
"Bought it over 2 months ago.  Still, no issues have arrived.  Order fulfillment is clearly not a strong point.  Is it any wonder the publishing business is dying?",1
The best magazine on the market,5
I think it is a good magazine but cannot stand that I cannot make sections larger on tap or have a reading view option.,3
Yes digital machinist met my expectations.,4

I'd rather have the print version without the daily multiple e-mails.,3

I loved this magazine so much I had this subscription sent to my grand-daughter in SC.,5
we can't live without it,5
It was alright. If you like Oprah. The magazine just reminded me why I don't watch her shows. Maybe I'm too young to get it. I just didn't find it relevant to me.,3
Very nice / informative mag for a person that is not heavily into agriculture. But helps alot for the hobby farmer or country living folk,4

"Great magazine, but I didn't want to renew but it did automatic. I didn't like that wished I would of know.",3

Poor articles and tons of ads. I cancelled my subscription.,1
"Not worth the $5.00. It is mostly ads and very Kardashian centeric. I thought it would be more about fashion, less E channel",1

"The product is okay, but the response from Import Tuner Mag has been VERY, VERY slow.  Do not plan on renewing subscription again!",2
"Not very many recipes, mostly pictures and advertisements. Not worth the $20 subscription.",2
I love this magazine in print but I like my Kindle magazines to have interactive material. Recipes have beautiful pictures and there are interesting articles in every issue.,4
I cannot believe the only way  too order these is on  a kindle(your loss) I was going to order more than one subscription.,1
"Enjoyed the 6mo. promo digital run, but will cancel when done.",3
I really enjoy all the articles. It covers a wide range of history  and each is well  argued .,4
A lot of advertising pages fee real content ,2
To expansive in ny opinion.,2
it is nice magazines for family or people who likes cooking and arts & crafts. Disappointed that each issue is having less coupons.,3
would love to read it but so far have been waiting three days for it to download and still cannot see more than the first two pages.  grrr.,1
"Every month, I find incredibly important health info in this magazine.  The info on the latest nutrition studies make this a must read.",5

It's a good magazine aside from to many pages of advertisements verses actual recipes.,4
Good magazine. I found the articles helpful,4
good magaznine,4
Such an awesome magazine. Love the different eras of history presented.,5
Informative. Not as relevant to me as Dressage Today.,3

Great writing,4

unless you're rich and you could bring it all to life with your unlimited bank account..,1
"I love Popular Mechanics and Popular Science.
So much new information, and so interesting.",5
"Good magazine, arrived quickly- but no free messenger bag.",4
I have read national geographic for as long as I can. Remember.,5
Love Dwell. Always great ideas.,5
Very bad. You don't get to read the magazine because it keeps downloading for ages. Another way of extorting money from innocent subscribers.,1
This is THE magazine for anyone who loves Egyptology. Filled with great photographs and informative articles. I know of no other journal like it for the layman.,5
my mom loves the magazine,5
"What a failure in marketing and price setting.
Enough has been in said in the other comments.
Whomever made the decision to price at this level should find another line of work.",1
Good articles and content,4
Love the wonderful projects and ideas. Photos are great! But most of the magazine is ads. Maybe if the ads included discounts or coupons it would be better.,4
"One of my favorite magazines, always something to enjoy!",5
Great deal on a good magazine,5
"I get that mags need ads to survive, but this is crazy. More than half of every issue is ads, digital or print. I won't be renewing.",2
Mom & I love this magazine!,5
"Got this two years in a row for my sis in law. She is obsessed with cooking and her, so it is always a hit and for 20 bucks how can you go wrong.",4

I am not a vegetarian but I was interested in vegetable and salad recipes for the summer time. It did not interest me much.,3
"I would say this is an ok magazine but I prefer Paula Deen, Southern Lady and TeaTime.  Others may like Cook's Country better.",3
"I love this magazine! But, it asked me how I rate the renewal. I hate that I have to pay double as a current customer! Why do I have to pay $30  and new subscribers $15?",1
the magazine is good. kindle/android format only not pc accessible. .,3
I subscribed to the magazine since we are going to spend time in Texas May 2013. Wanted information on local color and different places to visit. First issue was an okay start.,3
"not all of us have kindle fire or an iphone/ipad, not fair to the people that have kindle Touch.

Good information.,4
Tendencious magazine... leftist propaganda.,1
I like this magazine but I wish they didn't place so many adds for the purchase of purebred dogs. I wish more focus and information was based on rescue pets!,3
"Love the magazine, get it in print. FireHD is ok but slightly text is small and resolution a little blurry. Selective zooming works but it is a little lackluster.",3
wish it had more recipes than advertisements. Most of the places in it are where I will never be/go. Great for the world traveler...but it's not me.,3
I've received my first issue a few weeks ago. I love this magazine. The recipes turn out so good. I enjoyed cooking new dishes from the recipes.,4
"This is the best publication around, for book lovers of all genres.",5
Not too happy with Vanity Fair. Articles are just taken off the web. Will not renew.,2
Much prefer large print copy of this magazine.,2

Not as interesting as I hoped for...!!!,3
GREAT MAGAZINE MY WIFE CAN READ TO KEEP UP WITH THE GERMAN NEWS AND GOSSIP. THE COMPANY HAS A RELIABLE SERVICE CARRIER AND VERY FEW ERRORS.,5
Arrived on time and as described,4
Very good informative magazine with great recipes and food stories,4
"I've yet to receive my hard copy, and the digital All Access copy doesn't include iphones so I cannot access it.",1
"As with Popular Mechanics, a bit disappointed.",3
They renewed my subscription without notifying me first!  Did not subscribe again.,1
I only buy the magazine for the Gymboree/crazy 8 coupons. The actual content is so so.,3
I love this magazine.  One of my favorites for all the latest on nutrition and health.  This is one that I absolutely read from cover to cover each month!,5
"It's a fabulous magazine, but it is unreadable on my Kindle.  The type is ridiculously small and unreadable.  The format is wrong for Kindle.",1
Great recipes and easy to follow instructions. Love this magazine.,5
For a magazine about active healthy life it's full of ads for bad foods. I cancelled the subscription.,1
I am a magazine junkie at heart so I am stoked that I can now take my magazines anywhere without having all of the bulk,5
"I love this magazine, I read this cover to cover.  Very informative.
Should not have to use fillers for feedback.",5
Our daily paper often differs from what is listed in TV Guide.  And  it's usually correct. Why is this?  I can't rely on the TV Guide listings.,3
too much advertising too little information,2

"I love it.  I live in L.A. and really need to know what's going on, and this magazine gives me everything.",5

"will never order again,i am going to cancel it....its all advertisements!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!dont waste your money, nothing informative,not even alot of country homes or decor",1
"Neither the pictures nor the advice is all that great.  I'm a professional wildlife photographer, and I haven't learned anything new.",3
If you are into fishing and live in the lower half of the state this magazine is not going to be one you subscribe to more than once.,1
Too many ads!,3
Wish it would say that it was not for kindle fire before I bought it and spent money on it,1
Always loved this one!,5
"GQ hasn't sent any issues to me it's March I bought this is January and, yes I did purchase the print deal.",1

"Deceptive advertising: paid for 5 months at the very end of September, received the notice that billing will start in December.",1
Lots of easy recipes in every issue.,4
It took sooo long for the first issue to arrive I forgot I ordered it! Way overpriced for the subscription . Stay away from this investment,1
"80 pages of ads and only a few with advice, stories, reviews, or actual photography worth looking at.",2
The few things I actually liked in this magazine did not warrant the expense. I would not purchase again. There are many blogs that cover the same topics in a much better way.,2
I am disappointed that the magazine comes so late by mail - almost one week from the time you can buy it in the supermarket.,2
Meh. Thin mag. Not sure if I would subscribe again. I find at least one article that applies to my interest.,3
"This magazine is either good or bad,no in betweens. Each issue is different. Way to much advertisement. I have been reading Esquire for years. Worth the price for subscription.",3
"Great magazine, love to read!!",5
Yes Ill give five stars to this product because this is functional and works well.,4
Not formatted for K-Fire 8.,1
I love this publication because the patterns are stylish and up-to-date. I save every magazine and refer back to them when I'm looking for a new project.,5
Enjoyed my HGTV magazine!,4
I would not download this liberal rag app to my Kindle. Every article is about same-sex marriage or transgender lifestyle - no thanks!,1
"I love this magazine, for its in depth and interesting articles. I look forward to receiving it in my box montly.",5
I was pretty excited to find this magazine online and wanted to subscribe until I read ALLOW 12-16 weeks for delivery.  Columbus could have delivered the magazine sooner.,1
I only want the Sept issue!,1
"This is a first class magazine.  Well worth subscribing to.  Amazon is the least expensive place we know of to do so.  It covers ""classic"" aviation at its best.",5
Wish it was published more then 4 times a year. This is my favorite magazine and always look foward to reading,5
Fake news,1
This subscription seems to come intermittently. The magazine is mostly advertisements. We won't renew.,2
I thought that it would have the morning listings.  I would like to see Saturday and Sunday mornings listed in the TV guide.,3
Fantastic magazine at a great price.,5
Meh - I only found one or two recipes over the course of my year long subscription which peaked my taste buds interest. Beautiful photography and some useful hints/tips.,4

"My grandkids look forward to receiving this and love reading it. So much so, that I renewed it for a second year.",5
Too difficult to read on the Kindle.,2

Bought this as a gift for my Mom...This is her favorite magazine to read.,5

"This used to be a great magazine. Now it's a gender bending, value destroying, soul sucking piece of garbage. No thanks.",1
I've been a subscriber for many years and this mag. never gets stale.  Always something new on herbs and their usage.  I highly recommend it.,5

I love this magazine! I have read it for years and when I discovered I could read it on kindle I was ecstatic! It has something for everyone in it.,5
Great articles and recipes. Good magazine.,4
Great magazine for a nostalgic but far away New Englander.,4
"Title says it all. Is it coming, Amazon or what? Next time, order directly through the magazine rather than through a third party like Amazon.",3
I have still not received even the 1st copy. I ordered & paid for it several weeks ago.,1
I used to like Smart Money magazine a lot but they discontinued Smart Money. So you have only Money and Kiplingers now. This is a good mag for beginners and as a reference.,4
It's too slanted toward the Democrats.,2
Official Xbox Magazine gives the low down on new games.,4
I cannot navigate current history on my tablet,1
Love the interaction feature on the magazine!,5

this is a rip off i have the same magazine and i payed 20 bucks for magazines what a rip off gosh,1
I like reading all recipes from the website but the print in this online magazine is just too small to be useful. I cancelled my subscription only hours after starting it.,2
"If you like science, this is the magazine for you. Great gift. Excellent articles.",5
"I was expecting a format with more images to be seen in a kindle format, it is like a regular book.",3
one should have the opportunity to accept or reject 'auto renewal',1

"terrible, it is not the popular science I remember....and I cant unsubscribe.....TERRIBLE.....DONT BUY",1
love everything about this magazine,5
"I guess it takes getting use to.  It certainly doesn't replace the hard copy.  I missed all the adds that noted in the back of the mag giving information on vendors, etc.",2
This is a nice little read that gives you insight into lots of different things.  With a toddler I don't have much time to read so this helps me keep up.,4

Best magizine ever!!!,5
"Discover Magazine is my favorite magazine.  I've subscribed for a great many years, and read it from cover to cover.",5
Could be so much better if there weren't so many pages of advertisements.,2
Not available for Kindle Paperwhite 7th generation. That's a major bummer and a reason to cancel my subscription.,1
funny- great mag,4
I did not know I was signing up for auto-renewal and do not want the magazine anymore or the auto-renewal.  This was very misleading and I am not happy about it.,1
Way too many ads,2
Not the Yankee of old! Very disappointed. Too slick.,1
I just love every issue of Readers Digest because they have all sorts of articles and information that is good for everyone.,5
"Looks good on the covers, but projects are quite unrealistic and every issue is absolutely full of ads.",2
"Good magazine, I love the outdoors and this magazine has a lot of information. Makes me want to pack up and walk around the world.",5
It's not like a real magazine. Pages are black and even with few illustrations. They need to make it look like a real magazine like Google play does.,2
I have been a longtime reader and really enjoy the movie insight. The magazine also has a wonderful sense of humor.,5
Bought as a gift for my 7 year old grandson. He loves magazine.,5

Most left-wing liberal rag ever published.,1
Love it! One of the best magazines I've read!,5
Never received the clutch to go with the magazine which was a gift. Price was right though. Quick read and then it goes to a woman's center,1
Most of the content is for the uber rich.,3

Very disappointed. My daughter is an avid and advanced reader. The stories in Spider are mediocre at best. We won't be renewing.,2

Great magazine for reloads,4

Excellent and informative content. I enjoyed reading all of the articles and I really love my Kindle version!,5

No access to much if any information with digital version of the magazine. Waste of money and time. Do not buy!,1
Don't waste your time. Depressingly bereft of reason.,1
"Forgot how small the print is, seems like the magazine is smaller than it used to be. Canceled.",1
I use it every morning. The meditations give me something to ponder as I walk to work. It is helping me evaluate how I am living my life and helping me make better decisions.,4

this has to be the worst magazine ever... total waste. full of ads. nothing else.,1
My kids love this magazine. They are yoga teachers so that should tell you something about the quality of the contents.,5

articles are not very good,1
"I love the magazine. The renewal seemed to take a long time, though.",4

"Very little how to,  A lot of adds",3
Paid for magazine scrip over two months ago on Feb 27 th ...it is now may 4 th...and nothing...don't waste your time,1
This mag is over my yoga-ability and way more serious about the true yoga spiritualism than I am comfortable with.,3
there are far too many ads for this magazine to be worth while. The articles are not very interesting or useful.,2
I remember when this magazine first came out and it was a lovely work of art. now it's so thin and full of crap.,1
One of my favorite magazines,5
"Few articles or substance.  Why not merge with People and call it a day?
Zero interesting articles.....very little guidance or recommendations........
Will not renew",1
Good coverage of hunting in Southern Africa. Gears reviews are objective and concise. The magazine could use more content per issue.,4
I just got through reading my first issue and I absolutely loved it.  I plan on renewing at the end of the subscription.,5
Havent even got a magazine yet and i order in july,1

"The best price existing?!  This magazine is to read, watch and keep .... love this. So glad Amazon offered this for $5 a year. Unbelievable deal ever",5
I don't know why I was asked to review an item I have not yet received.  I oredered the magazine in July (over a month ago) and my son has not received the first issue yet.,1
Great little magazine on health.,4
This magazine surrendered its last vestiges of credibility when choosing to peddle snake oil and promote the charlatan Food Babe.  Shameful.,1
Love Readers Digest as always. However my first issue was very late in arriving.,4
Its o.k. but I like the actual magazine better. It is easier to see the patterns and keep it in hand when doing a project.,4
Very informative and interesting. Great way to pass time!!,4
"beatiful magazine, very good ideas, excellent pictures, good recipes  nice and useful magazine,i would like more desserts recipes. but i like it",4

Didn't care for the magazine.  Too many ingredients I don't normally have on hand.,2
First time.. There are too many advertisements and not enough pictures and content... so far..,2
"More materialistic than anything, not an accurate portrayal of the average yogis world. Needs more substance and less ads",3
i love redbook it is a awesome magazine. I am hapy to be able to renew my subscription and think it is a great magazine for all women.,5
It won't download wirelessly or to my computer for transfer via USB.  I only bought a single issue but are now leery of buying magazines.  This one says Kindle Edition.,1
"Each issue is filled with so much information that no matter who you are, there is always SOMETHING you can use.",5
This magazine has really gone downhill. It's sooooo thin there's almost no point in reading it....it's all advertisements,2
I did not want to renew this item and did not know it is set up for automatic renewal. I was not able to cancel because it was automatically renewed.,1
I subscribe and Takes abot four months to get the first so I get it at the news stand but is nothing good On it!,3
This is truly a great magazine!  I've been getting it for over six years and will continue my subscription.,5

i love humor and gossip and this is not my type of magazine no way,1
"Good. Not as diverse as would like, but still a good idea magazine",3
Best home-decorating magazine ever! Officially considered best in Europe; nothing even comes close in the USA!!!!,5
This is an excellent publication.  Provides informative interesting information as well as great humor.  An easy read and highly recommended.,5
is hard to read it un horizontal way,3
Good mag filled with lots of info-- probably better suited to younger people but I still found lots to enjoy.,4
"If you'd prefer your child not be sold-to on every page, then don't bother with this magazine. What a disappointment. Shame on National Geographic.",1

Giving Donald Trump so much cover time is disturbing. Had to unsubscribe..,1
"Always been an excellent, balanced, unbiased source of intelligent information.",5
My father likes this .,4
Vogue has been one of my favorite magazines forever. September issue is the best. Love the food articles by Jeffrey S.,5
"This is a awesome magazine for learning about the greatest up-and-coming rock bands.  It has great articles and is over-all very, very rad!!  ROCK ON DECIBAL!!!",5
"It's just a waste of money for the price, but I paid $20 for a year when I bought it a month ago so I just got ripped off.",1
son said it was ok.,3
"Got it as a gift for my mother, and she seems to love it. The reason for the four stars is that it's very pricey!",4
I purchased this magazine in July and was told that I would receive it in October and that Amazon had no control over this. Then why are you selling it???,1
Started reading this as a kid.....my father had a subscription starting in the 1920's........my son LOVES this magazine......so I renewed for him.  Got a great price!!,5
I used to really like Self but it seems like they are trying to appeal to a much younger demographic.  I won't be subscribing anymore.,3
I ordered my Oprah magazine subscription a month ago now. I still haven't recieved my first issue. Still waiting......,1
"I say this about most of my current paper prescripts, this one is better online than in hard copy.  Too many ads to get to substance.",3
Minimal Content - The items / products promoted by Oprah are clearly intended for people who have a paycheck of Oprah's bank account or thereabouts.,1
"My favorite magazine. Great hints for gifts, decorating, etc. I save them in a big basket and review them often.
Pat N",5
"Since I am a beginner, I would like to see some articles and projects for a new Knitter. I buy Piecework all the time, but sometimes feel left out.",3

How do I cancel this frigging thing?!,1
This is one of my favorite magazines for recipes!,5

Not as informative as I had hoped.,2

Long lead time for the orders. After few weeks time I am still waiting to get the first issue...,1
I was not allowed to download so i request to cancel the suscription and they didn't do it. I tried all the options they have to download but none of them worked.,1
Best mag out there,5

Not the magazine that it use to be.  Not southern cooking.,2
"Only have received one magazine, not impressed with this one",1
"Loved it in the past, however they changed their magazine layout, and I no longer like the magazine.",3

Some of the topics / articles don't relate to a 10 year old (4th grader going into 5th grade),3
I can't get it on my ipad only my phone.  Will only be using the trial period.,1
This is ok.  You can't manipulate the digital copy to make the print larger.  It reads exactly as the print copy.  Bummer.,3

Good but not great.,3

"I was looking forward to the Kindle version of the Economist, but this is too expensive for an electronic version.",1
I have not received the magazine yet and my daughter is pissed!,1
Compared to Arts and Crafts mag.  This is nothing.  Money better spent elsewhere if you want ideas for a craftsman style home,1
I've been a big fan of Hobby Farm for several years and I love receiving this magazine in my mailbox!,5
Another magazine just for advertisements,1
This magazine  is not what I was expecting.,2
"Remember the old Glamour magazine that used to have such great articles with some ads here and there? this is not it!
 this is all ads targeted to young women.",2
In the current issue there is on Kindle no mention of the author of the cover review essay.  Vexing.  It is high time the ole TLS get its Kindle version up to snuff.,1
Lots of ads.,3
Love the recipes....the photographs are beautiful.,5
Not for me. Articles did not engage my interest.,2

Enjoy the online edition.,4

I hate to think I paid for something I did not get. But I am a newbie at my Kindle. Perhaps you have suggestions.,1

Best subscription ever.,5
Love the different food genres,4
"I was hoping for more technical than what was there. it seems to be more like ""look how cool this is"" than a technical publication. It's like sport compact car, but for computers.",3

Didn't order this.  PLEASE DON'T ORDER THIS MAGAZINE.,1
useless data.,1
Magazine has too many ads and not enough content loved it 20 years ago,1

Cancelled my subscription.  Heavy political tilt.  I just want info about the technology - not why we should or should not be adopting it.,1

"it does not come regularly. In fact, i have only received 3 when i should have gotten about 6 so far.",1
the nation is probably one of the poorist publications i have read to date.  do not waste your time on this .,1

This is a great weekly magazine that gives me updates and information on the most current of events.,4
More pages of ads than stories!,2

"The Economist. I like it but it is a trifle expensive for my pocketbook.  To buy it now and then is okay, but not a subscription to the magazine.",3
It is a wonderful magazine. I read several articles and they were very inspirational.  The magazine is beautifully illustrated and very colorful.,5

Articles are written by five year olds.,1
