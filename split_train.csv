Difficult to use; prefer paper copy.,0
Magazine has gone off the rails.,0
i have ordered a trial of this magazine almost two months ago and still have not received a single copy,4
Read above. I have tried other magazines about diabetes and this one is tops. I have suggested to friends and family.,4
A wonderful book. Stories are about real people and are true. I have read guidepost for years.,4
A great publication for pilots.,4
I love this magazine and this is such a great deal you would be stupid to turn it down.,4
"Ordered the magazine in August and was told it would not start until December, it better be worth the wait, will not renew script, birthday gift turned Christmas gift.",0
"Renewing this magazine is a mistake, as all the info is recycled over time.  Nothing really new after you've received it for a year.",1
Another great magazine for wife.,3
mag is ok it was free so cant really complain but its ok to look at,2
Considering the magazine will not download even one star is too many. I will be calling for a full refund.,0
Too many advertisements for me.,2
Love the paper but managing the subscription has been a nightmare.  Probably won't renew again.,0
Loved reading it in the nail parlor but the ads have changed. Not enough good deals. Used to have fabulous little inserts. Where are they? Disappointing clothes.,0
I Love Crochet World!  You can always find fun patterns.  I enjoy getting it and just looking!,4
never subscribed to this magazine,0
We aren't using it as much as we thought we would. Primetime schedule only; no day time.,2
As of May 17 I have yet to receive my first issue so I cannot recommend it. It is disapointing that it is taking so long to begin my subscription.,1
I ordered a subscription for my husbands birthday.  The first issue arrived perfectly ontime and he was thrilled with the gift.,4
Awesome  ,4
"Very buggy for kindle fire (not HD). Weekly Cheat Sheet(formerly what to watch) NEVER works.
Also, you can't zoom in on photos.
Bad app.",0
Love this magazine and it came quicker than it said.,4
"I was excited about getting this.  But since January, I've only received one issue.  I'm kind of disappointed in that.",2
Font way too small for a 7inch tablet. When  enlarged it on my hdx everything was out of focus.,0
"Excellent magazine for those of us that live in Ohio and like to go to festivals, places in and around Ohio.",4
Such a great magazine to relieve free as a Prime Member. Love it!,4
I didn't mind the magazine. It had some good recipes. I stopped reading when I got to the Monsanto add. What a sell out.,0
Really not good.,0
I'm reading it on my kindle and it's difficult to get to different sections. That's my only complaint on the magazine,2
"Started receiving my issues a few weeks after I ordered them and there's been no problems, just a great deal!",3
Retains the flavor of old time hunting with a delivery time of 3 to 4 months for first issue.,0
Overall the magazine is pretty good. Easy reading. Gives me something to do for about 15 min's a month. Came during the time advertised.,3
Subscription not received,0
"This seems to be more about interior design, not construction issues and/or remodeling.",1
"I haven't received magazine yet or any notification as to when I will get it
It would be nice to know when i can stop buying it in store",0
"I loved this magazine, but they recently went out of business. Don't subscribe. I heard they were still taking subscriptions but there will be no future magazines.",2
This is the magazine we all grew up with now on our Kindle. Absolutely captivating articles and pictures that will take you to the moment. I LOVE THIS MAGAZINE!!!!,4
Not much info for me,2
Maxim has gone downhill over the years.  More of a yuppie mag now than appealing to the average Joe.,2
"Yes, I've taken P.S. Life for years and enjoy it",3
Its has been my favorite magazine since I was 18 years old.  Im 48 now.,4
This magazine has products and clothing that the average person couldn't afford. Other than than it was just ads. I cancelled after my trial.,0
My favorite mag. Good price as well,4
It has been more than 8 weeks since Iplaced my order  and I still have not received my first issue.  Very disappointed in how long it takes to get the subscripton going.,0
Best motorcycle magazine.  Objective and truthful source of information about all things motorcycle.,4
"I received a letter telling me that they were not publishing the magazine anymore, and replaced it with Glamour, so no, not happy.",0
Great ideas with food recipes!,3
I have two Kindles and an iPad on the way and can't get an app for the magazine? I have a subscription also. Agravating! Can't even get an app for it. Why?,0
very good but hard time getting larger words but love getting the month free offer i probably will continue to buy it,3
it is so much smaller than I expected but the kids will like it I hope.,2
"Sick adverts Pop Mechanics. Literally almost every other page has an ad on it, mostly about cars or tobacco related paraphernalia. 1/10, would not read again",0
So many ads not enough recipes.,0
Some of the writing was clinical and detached. Some was very lively and fun. The poetry was nice. Very good value for the money.,3
I enjoy the variety of recipes,3
"The writing can be good at times but honestly, if you're not into narrative style sports writing, you're better off with another publication.",2
Delivery is right on time. I love the recipes.,4
Us Weekly cannot go a week without a Kardashian on the cover.  I am sick of hearing about this family.  I didn't renew my subscription.,2
I have learned something from every issue and this is my 3rd year of reading this mag. I highly recoment it,4
It was okay but over priced,1
This is the best gift that I could give my oh so sports minded nephew each and every year on his birthday!  Thank you!,4
"Great price, great magazine.",4
Cancelled my (long time) subscription. Not sure why they feel the need to mix political cuck opinion (Zach Bowman) into a car magazine.,1
Only wish there were more horse classified ads in the magazine,3
"If you're into high fashion, this magazine is for you.  There are way too many advertisements in this magazine when you are reading it.",2
"Too much ads inside, not much content",1
"That's pretty much all. It was supposedly coming on April 26, but it's been ~10 days. Kind of starting to doubt it will arrive.",0
Very good magazine with decent reading materials.,2
"I would love to review on this, but I have yet to receive my subscription! When will I get it??? If I don't get it soon, I will expect to receive a refund.",0
Having this publication on my Kindle is great.  I started reading RD at my aunt's when I was 9 and still love to browse the magazine.  I can do that now anyplace that has WiFi.,3
Have not received any issues since purchase.,0
the subscription is great. I receive a paper copy but I luv having the mag on my kindle. you have more options.,3
"not a real subscription! cannot search for products, only read the current issue",0
1 article and 15 advertisements.,1
"Beautiful photography, informative stories.  One of the best magazines around and one that the whole family can enjoy.  Love it!",4
Provides practical tips and advice for every area in your life.,3
"The perfect bite-sized goodness.  A work of art, a short story and a poem.  I look forward to this every week.",4
This was a gift and I know that my son had enjoyed having it though he didn't request a renewal,2
So happy I could find this on Amazon Magazine subscriptions! This is my husbands favorite and such an easy way to manage it right through my Amazon account.,4
The magazine is chocked full of interesting places to visit and make lasting memories.  I am going to enjoy and make the most of my six issues of this magazine.,3
"Too many ads in the magazine-almost every other page is an ad! Also, many of the stories are fluff, with no real content to them. Not my kind of magazine anymore...",1
"can't be better,a a a a a a a a a  a a a mazon! i love you amazonnnnnnn n n n",4
Too many ads.  Cant tell ads from the recipes.,1
"Great magazine! Smart, intelligent, humorous.",4
I bought this Magazine for my grandson's High School Graduation. He is enjoying it.,0
Great Price - Love Rachael's Mag!,4
When they switched from the old app I can't access any of the back issues I  was saving. Go back to the old app or fix this one.,0
"Not quite what I had hoped for. Too many ads, and too many complicated recipes. Not for me.",1
I am very disappointed because I bought this magazine and it was not delivered and loaded to my device.,0
"Money is a good solid ""Money Magazine"".  I still prefer Kiplinger the best.",3
Wonderful & fun to read.,4
Awesome recipes with easy instructions and good pictures.  I can't wait to get this every month in my mailbox!!  Great addition to the food channel.,4
Best home-decorating magazine ever! Officially considered best in Europe; nothing even comes close in the USA!!!!,4
I tried to order Maxim twice from Amazon and never received it either time.  I will never order a magazine etc. from amazon again!,0
My favorite magazine - and I love subscription auto-renewal,4
Great magazine for reloads,3
Great if you have a device that can read it,0
IT IS A WEIRD MAGAZINE TO READ... IT IS NOT SET UP LIKE A NORMAL MAGAZINE WITH EASY TO FIND ARTICLES BUT MORE OF SHORT DITTIES ON A LARGER VARIETY OF SUBJECTS...,3
never ordered,0
not as great as i hoped. not a lot of interesting recipes inside.,1
This magazine is worth every penney with the great money saving tips and large selection of coupons in it.  It is the best magazine a woman can purchase!,4
"Love the magazine but its ridiculous to pay over $100 a year for a digital magazine.
I'll be canceling it after the 30 day free promo.",0
"Okay, but not the magazine I remember from years ago.",1
Not yet received. Why in the world does AMX Publishing take so long? Bad for their corporate reputation.,0
all gimmick and hype with your cover girl vani hari.,0
"I have a subscription for the Digest, but for some strange reason, I have yet to receive January 2010.  I am not happy about this.",2
My favorite magazine. Fun and informative articles for history lovers. Wish I could download past issues.,4
this magazine will mostly give you complex advertizing disguised as reviews and reports. very little practical use.,0
Nothing but ads,0
"Great magazine, good tips and tricks that you can apply to every day riding.",3
Too many ads!!!,2
mostly advertisment. boring stuff. very few new ideas for reusing things...,1
The liberal media run amok. It's sad that such an iconic periodical has been seized and destroyed by political protagonists.,0
exactly what I was expecting and delivered super fast! thanks!,4
"Tells people how-to paint, not about art making.",1
It's not the greatest. Like all mags nowadays it's mostly all adds. Most of the info offered is all free online.,1
Great magazine with wonderful tips and trends but never as good as the hard copy version. Great for travel though.,2
Advertisements,0
"pretty sure I never read one of these that came in, i don't see the need for someone my age to order this (age 25).",1
this magazine  stopped  coming to my kindle though my subscription is still active.  so now i pay for the subscription pkus individual issues.,0
For a magazine about active healthy life it's full of ads for bad foods. I cancelled the subscription.,0
"Received quickly, very happy with purchase.",4
Great and inexpensive ideas for the home.,2
"Being a traditional quilter, the so-called new ""fabric and pattern choices"" does not quite appeal to me.  Neither does the many small project designs.",2

I love the creative and thought provoking design ideas. I appreciate the articles that consider cost saving construction methods and also the interior decorating ideas.,3
I like it a lot so far.,3
This magazine has become nonsense.,0
ESPN will make you put in a credit card number to get access to the insider service even after you get your first magazine.,0
Magazines are just one of these things that aren't like they used to be.,2
"what can i say, it's a motorcycle consumer new mad....good info",2
"The stories are varied and well written.
No dislikes!
We don't know of anyone who would appreciate these stories as we do.",4

"i like the magazine, but can't figure out how to cancel the auto renew.",1

Good magazine for unbiased product reviews.  I don't like it that they hit me up for a donation a few times a year.,3
I never received this magazine so how would I be able to rate it??  I cant even find a way to let them know I never received it.,0
It was just what I was looking for. Will use it every day.  Very inspiring.  Wonderful for Advent and beyond.,4
print was too small and I was unable to use Kindle feature to enlarge it.  Was unable to read it.,0
This should be free before any one buys it.,0
I hadn't read Woman's Day in a while. I found the variety of topics interesting and enjoyable to read.,3
I love the articles in this magazine.  They're very insightful and ahead of their time.  I've had a subscription now for years,4

Good magazine. I found the articles helpful,3
My all time favorite.  Best articles  good variety.,4

*Small* print. Please teach more!",2
"FAR more left-wing than I remembered from years ago.  If you tend to be left-wing, this magazine will by and large reinforce your positions.  ""Fair",1
Some good recipes but really seems like every other page is an advertisement as the time goes on.,2
"I love this product as it really gave me information on what was going on in the sports world, especially for those who are kids.",4
My mother and I read it cover to cover.  Worth it!,4
Love seeing all these ideas about crocheting. Love the format and the designs. Also the directions seem easy to understand.,3

Meaningless!!! just page after page ad...content is nothing to be excited about...Don't buy,0
Oprah was a $5.00 magazine for one year so it was hard to pass up. Perhaps a 3.5 to 4 stars may have been better. But quite frankly I purchased it for the great price.,2
Difficult to view online.,1
Allure sent me 3 magazines in the space of a month in order to get rid of back issues. Very disappointed.,0

Plenty of easy recipes,3
not as expected,1

"you're a business magazine, not a right wing political magazine.  Steve Forbes' greatest problem is that he's NOT HIS FATHER.",2

"I've wanted this magazine for 6 months, and finally splurged and got it.

I love reading this magazine each week!  Puts all other news magazines to SHAME!",4

"Always some nice photo shoots, though they tend to go back to grungy a bit often for my taste these days.",3
I ordered on Oct 24 and as of Nov 30 I have not rec. so I can not review Amazon service but I do love this great coupon magazine when I have bought it at the store.,2

Great magazine full of recipes and information on eating healthy. I would recommend this magazine for anyone who wants to change to a healthier lifestyle.,3
not a interesting as i thought it would be,2
Great recipes that include basic nutritional data so you can easily decide if a dish is right for you. Easy to navigate on Kindle Fire. Tablet bonuses are great.,3
The subscription process was easy ant the first issue came earlier than estimated .Price was half of a renewal,3
One of my favorite magazines.  I always sit down within an hour of delivery to view the images and read the articles,4
I liked the older version better since I was able to access older copies much easier than with the new one.,0
Cheap. Threw it away immediately.,0
Just received my first issue...earlier than expected...enjoy this magazine much!  I like reading issues from a man's point of view.,3

"I've been subscribing to this magazine since it first came out, and never plan on missing an edition! Simple, timely, and great for a vegetarian household.",0

"Won't download on any of my devices - 2 Fires, Paperwhite, Kindle Keyboard, android phone or my computer. Waste of money",0
"Good for those who want to learn more about health, exercises, and beauty.",2
Horrible beyond description. Bad customer service and declining quality of articles as well. I will walk away,0
After 3 months I'm still waiting for the first exemplar.,0
I get my subscription very late in the month or not at all. Not consistent.,0
Good articles. Easy to find what you're looking for.,3

This month's (Sep issue) Kindle Road & Track has been  supplanted by an issue of Seventeen magazine.,0

Love reading and getting new ideas. Always room for improvement that's why I didn't give 5 stars,3
Ridiculous that paying for the online edition doesn't get you access to the Kindle version as well,0

Vain Hair? Really? I'm unsubscribing.,0
"Don't know what happened or who to call, going on 7 weeks and still no magazine.",0

Definetley wasn't what i was looking for. I wanted recipes .  Paid 3.99 pretty much for nothing. Wish i could have gotten my money back.,0

looked at it myself but I believe it must be good because these kids have
everything!",2

Great magazine and love Jimmy the Bartender...,4
There is very little substance to this magazine. It is primarily advertisements.,1
"My husband LOVES this magazine. It is just technical enough to keep his interest, but not too much to where he can't understand the articles. It is a great gift subscription.",4
My fiance enjoyed reading the books.  And I than the Amazon team for great customer service..,2
"The O magazine is great and Amazon offered a great deal.  Great articles, pictures and enjoyable to read.",4
This is quite the intense magazine. Lots of step by step projects that seem helpful. It just doesn't seem as relevant today with all of the available free DIY resources out there.,2
Anyone interested in how the mind works can't help but be fascinated by nearly every article in each issue.,3
I'm sure I would love this except I can't download it and I've been charged for it!,0
"I've paid, but I never see the magazine anywhere. Wasted 3,99.- for nothing. I wish I could get my money back.",0

Its an ok mag.,1
"I love it!  Complete with a shopping list.  Although, I wish it had even more recipes!",2
"Probably is a good stuff for people who knows the art of crochet; but , it did not feel the expectations of my wife. For entertaiment of beginners is not a good guide.",1
This magazine is quite dull and uninformative. How about a bit more technique or something useful? Nothing left to say to reach word minimum.,0
"Their website used to be an authority site. Now, they have turned it in to a pop ad, spam site? Its crap!",0
"Love this magazine. Love how thick it is, and how I try so hard NOT to read it all the first day I get it. : ) Highly recommended.",4

Navigation is my only issue. Loved the recipes. Hate trying to find them in the awkward application. Otherwise I enjoy reading it.,2

Print is hard to read.,2
Doesn't allow reading from different panes (both vertical and horizontal views). One is restricted to only vertical reading.,2
We did not receive the tote,0

Fiction, reviews, opinion and cartoons.
What's not to love?",4

What girl doesn't love Cosmo and a glass of wine! Have been reading this forever. Even caught my boyfriend reading it!,4

I've been reading this magazine for 25 years and is always a pleasure.,3
very hard to use since they discontinued the app last year. was great now it pretty useless.,0

Grandfather loves it!! At 91 and owning his own car parts store years ago this is great for him.,4
Informative but couldn't get into the lifestyle.,2

Way to many ads and not enough useful information....,0

Magazine is not too bad. Got 1 year cheap prise.  The system renewed it without my permission,1
This a magazine that is dedicated to advertisements.  I'm not even sure there are any articles in it.  I search but don't really find any.,0
If a 5 month subscription is $114 then each magazine would be $22. I think savings listed is false advertising.,0
This subscription seems to come intermittently. The magazine is mostly advertisements. We won't renew.,1
I currently subscribe to this magazine and don't want to order a new subscription to have it available on my kindle.  Bad call.,1
Can't live without my Vogue,0

American Scientist is much better and deeper. This now seems like it is for 9th graders or something.,2

Could never figure out how to get it on my device since it doesn't work on the kindle app. Also paper copy is lame and thin,0
I've read similar issue articles in other publications.  Very disappointed that writer's opinion is forefront and central to the articles throughout the magazine.,1
I subscribed to the magazine since we are going to spend time in Texas May 2013. Wanted information on local color and different places to visit. First issue was an okay start.,3
A good look at cars and trucks.. foreign and domestic. It also reports on trends and influences on the industry.,3
Love this magazine and love that I can take it on my devices anywhere!,4
I have loved this magazine for years...I have enjoyed it just as much on my tablet!,4
"An interesting concept--all sorts of stories.  Some are fun to read and some are strange, but I rather like the idea.",2
I love this magazine.  I can learn new things about all things local and even get directed to the hole in the wall places in town that are fantastic!,4
Seems to be an advertisement catalogue more than a hotrod magazine lately.  still a few decent articles,2
"It's a magazine subscription, what's to say, it shows up on time, and every month, if you like it you do.",3
"Took well over a month to get here, but it has lots of helpful articles",2
The daily Republi-con talking points begin with the drug report then are repeated by druggie Limbaugh. Save yourself the money.,0
"I have not received even one issue yet, what seems to be the problem?????? I am giving no stars whatsoever, and I demand an explanation!",0
Very helpful for everyday sewing. Should have more wearable fashion sewing articles and how-to features particularly for the older woman.,3
its a good magazine but truly for the younger set 20-30 although there was a few things that interested me.  not really my thing but i am a grandma young one but still a grandma,2
Great magazine! Great ideas in every issue!,4
"THIS MAGAZINE IS GREAT AND THE PRICE WONDERFUL, YOU CAN NOT GET A BETTER DEAL .  I AM SO GLAD I GOT THIS EMAIL AND GOT A RENEW SUBSCRIPTION.  THANKS",4
this is one of my favorite magazines so I couldn't pass up the one year subscription $5 price.  it's loaded with yummy recipes.,4
Grandchildren enjoyed these with their parents,3
"I have only received one issue since October, but I'm assuming that's mostly due to the postal service. I love the magazine itself.",3
Great publication. Lots of great resources and stories. Real Motivation for ANY entrepreneur! I especially love the 10 tips to build wealth that can be found in every issue.,4
This magazine consists more of ads than articles. Greatly disappointed.,0
The pictures are pretty but I'm finished with my international travel in my life.,1
"First off, I bought a 1yr subscription & only received 4-5 magazines.  Absolute joke.  Very disappointed and refuse to read this magazine ever again.",0
TOO YOUNG FOR ME,3

Get magazine. Love the old stories.,4
I do not wish to renew this magazine as it does not have the content I am looking for.please cancel subscription,1
Wonderful magazine!,4
There is too much fluff in the magazine. I realize they want to appeal to a younger generation but they made it too much like People magazine. It needs more in depth articles.,2
"A good combination of easy recipes, with nutritional information now added, to inspire you in the kitchen and help you keep the calories in check if are watching what you eat.",3
How would I know if I like it or not? I haven't seen an issue since subscribing several months ago.,0
The Kindle subscription price for this publication is absurd ($35 annually more expensive than the print version),0
i used to read and like businessweek before it became bloomberg busweek.articles are not well researched and lack in quality. i am cancelling my subscription.,0
this magazine is not as good as it used to be,2
waited over 6 months for our first issue.....then we received only one issue .....my daughter was so disappointed.,0
"I was so happy to find this issue, at such a great price, with two of my favorite shows included: Frasier and The Waltons. Thank you for a smooth transaction all around!",4
"Wow... so this is what a ""magazine"" with 99% ads looks like... Cosmo isn't this bad, please don't waste your money.",0
One of my favorite magazines to pick up and read. Finally broke down and purchased it online thru Amazon. I received my first issue in about three (3) weeks.,4
Okay but does have damage on cover when I get them in mail,2
"Crappy magazine, got the subscription for free.",1
"This was to extend my existing subscription.....instead you have made me a new one which duplicates
mine,  Can you remedy this?  I do not need two magazines!",0
I purchased this magazine in July and was told that I would receive it in October and that Amazon had no control over this. Then why are you selling it???,0
The content is often quite good. But the use of dark colored papers makes it difficult to read.,3
Countryside and Small Stock Journal is an excellent resource for those contemplating farming or homesteading. In addition advertisers have many hard to find necessities,3
We only received 1 magazine for a subscription.,1
"Make sure you receive your gift.  Because once you pay, you're just a number.",0
I would say its too small. It also often gets torn up in the mail and you really don't get very many magazines for the price you pay.,1
"Not as good as it used to be, but still okay",2
I love that I got a whole year of this for only $5! What a steal! Happy to finally have some magazines!,4
"I guess it takes getting use to.  It certainly doesn't replace the hard copy.  I missed all the adds that noted in the back of the mag giving information on vendors, etc.",1
The best magazine ever!!!,4

"A wonderful magazine for food, plants, and anything else you want to know about the South!",4

Enjoy the magazine for all of the different and helpful articles.,3
Great articles. I have only received 2 issues but both have had several valuable articles that I enjoyed reading. I look forward to the next issue.,3
Not a craft mag. All about buying crafts. Filled with ads for pricey crafts that only the rich can afford,0
"My Aunt Cleo recommended this magazine to me 45 years ago. Great magazine, articles for true self improvement.  The magazine keeps getting better and better.",0
Love the Kindle version!,4
Just not the kind of reporting I expected. Search online and you will get better information for less.,1
I ordered the magazine because I'm thinking about buying a new car. Mostly I enjoy reading the reviews and seeing pics of latest model cars. It definitely fills the bill.,3
"Quality of writing has slipped badly. Should be an alternative to digital media, not a stylistic clone",2

"So far, they have only sent me one issue, which came LATE after the month had already passed. (I got the September issue in October. Really?)",0
A lot of the articles I wasn't interested in.  It had a good write-up so I thought I'd check it out.,0
My husband loves this magazine and it is great that we can set up an automatic renewal. We will continue with this magazine it is great for your military collectors.,4
It was OK. I didn't renew.,2
every week my tv guide arrives late.  if this continues I will cancel my order and just buy it at the local market.,1
I am VERY disappointed with this magazine. The content is weak & the fashion pages are certainly not aimed toward the every-day woman. It's weird & poorly done.,1
"Read it cover to cover every week. And I always have to start at the back page Bullseye.
Great mag",4
I've tried everything and can't open the app.,0

unless you're rich and you could bring it all to life with your unlimited bank account..,0
It's an OK magazine for the price. Good things in it but it isn't great  quick read and a few good recipes or ideas.,2
Great magazine at a very reasonable price. When I am finished my Grandsons love this magazine. Better renewal price on Amazon.,4
Excellent Mag. have been reading it for more then 8  years. coupled with digital & magazine makes it the best of both worlds,4
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to review a magazine in November that I was told I would not receive until December or January.,0

Do not want to renew don't read that much called to cancel guess you didnot get the message don't want to renew Southern Living,2

Great articles and cycle info,4

The copies I received did not even look like real magazines. They looked like promotional magazine samples. Mostly ads. Very little content.,0
Nice magazine with plenty of D.I.Y. articles.,3
50-60% advertisements. I guess that is why it only costs $5 a year...,2

"Ordered this for my brother in law, who loves golf. What a bargain price for a great magazine !!  Thanks",4
I love Reader's digest. Great mini stories and articles.,4
Totally unacceptable!!!!  I would like a refund to my account - This TV Guide doesn't display t-v shows except for 7 p.m.-11 pm-,0
"Great magazine, seems a little shorter than the paper copy. Love the recipes and new ideas though! I plan to cook a few of them soon!",3
Nice layout; easy for little ones to go through. A few more pages would be welcomed.,3
Mostly advertisements.,2
"I have no comment on the quality of the magazine itself, but I have yet to see my first issue, despite the fact that I ordered it a long time ago.",0
I used to save them now I throw them away the day I get them and will never renew after 50 years as a  reader and subscriber.  Hefner has lost his mind to allow this!!!!,0
I wouldnt buy ANYTHING from this woman after she has been free pr for Obama's healthcare bill aka Socialized medicine!,0
is hard to read it un horizontal way,2
This is the perfect magazine for the cook in your life. It offers great recipes and helpful hints from the Foodnetwork stars.,4
Very one side. Sounds like a  Democrat review. I just expect a more well rounded information source without so many opinions.,1
My free trial issue would not load.  Useless.,0
I have not been able to open this magazine. What is the problem. I can not review if I don't get it.,0
This is a fun mag because I often get stumped when searching for things about which to write. I like it very much.,2
I renewed this magazine for a great price - couldn't ask for a better deal.  I have been getting this for years!,4
Watch out for the advertising,3
Ok I guess. A little too liberal for my liking...,1
I love the magazine..but not on a kindle...wouldn't load right.......frustrating....thought it would be conviniant. It was a hassle. Never did down load right.,0
"has been impossible to access back issues, tho I see they are attempting to remedy this.  Not enough articles of interest to me to make it worth the price.  I am not renewing.",2
It did not download.  I ask for a refund but to date that has not happened.,0
"Warning. Downloading from this site, and reading the material will cause your Kindle to become inoperable, or, at least in my case--more than once.",0
I ordered this as a gift for a friend and he loves that his order is very discrete and comes to his mail box around the same time each month.,4
"This magazine tends to be a bit male-centric and can get wrapped up in high testosterone adventures, but anyone who enjoys outdoor activities should appreciate this.",3
This is not the CT of my seminary days. I am saddened to say I am canceling my subscription. CT has become a progressive political means of their rhetoric.,0
My granddaughter absolutely loves this magazine and eagerly awaits the arrival of this publication.  This made a perfect birthday gift this year.,4
some months much better than others but overall ok,2
"This is the best magazine for sewing with many items, I love it. You just follow instructions. It's easy and fun to make something",4

I didn't know!.",3
First issue was good! Looking forward to getting others.,3
"Would rather have the magazine in my hands
Would not buy another magazine. Sorry just

On the latest in health and fitness and challenges me with every issue. Wish I had been reading it a long time ago.,4
Clear writing and thoughtful articles - great reading for anyone interested in contemporary Catholic thinking!,4
Great resource for learning about future MLB players.,3
"My niece was suppose to receive in March, now they are saying April",1

Covers everything from a $17,000 car to a $2,000,000 car.",4
I love how many recipes come in the magazine.,4
Find it hard to read and not the type of historical info I am used to reading.  Do not want any more copies!,0
Enjoy reading this magazine.,3
"I love wired, and i love print magazines, i'm sorry i just do. Great buy!",4
Love Readers Digest as always. However my first issue was very late in arriving.,3

"I got the tote and I get emails, but I have not gotten a magazine.",0
This is my favorite photography magazine.,4
Would not recommend!  Very dissappointed in the magazine. I cancelled It.  It is all product advertisement. Good if you are looking for product choices.,0
It's just one long advertizement for clothes.  Not much by way of articles to read.,0
Would not let me have access.  Media protected.  Waste of my money.  None of my books will let me gain access.,0
"love this magazine, much better than glamour. got it much faster than expected and got two issues back to back.",4
Daughter isn't interested in them. Very wordy.,1
GREAT LOVED IT-WONDERFUL-SUPPER,4
"There articles are alright, but they screw you on the amount you get as i only got 10 of the 12 months subcription. so be carefull unless you are on the auto renew.",2
I don't recall ordering this in Spanish.,0
"Most of the articles would never download.  Just a blank screen that said ""waiting to download.""",0
"The magazine itself is great. So far, it's been months and we've only received two. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",2
Each issue seems to have a limited scope - one or few topics or people - if you're not into that topic or person then pretty much the whole issue is a bust.,1
I like it - but won't get it again.,3
"Very informative and an excellent source for learning photography, gives the reader the opportunity to review the various lens and camera equipment, prior to shopping .",3
I don't know why I get this publication I don't want it but yet it shows up every month!!  this is not for me.,0
Magazine is nothing but advertisements,0
"Lots of good ideas.  And lots of advertising .

..",3
"Okay, but cancelled after one year. Took a very long time for the first issue to arrive.",1
I cancelled this subscription because my present subscription is good until 2016!,0

Lots of adds.  Light on content.,2
Love this magazine. So many places I never knew about are featured I feel I will never see them all. But I'm trying!! Love the upcoming events pages. Even the ads are awesome.,4
"GOOD MAG. SO FAR, ONE MONTH MISSING FROM THIS 2 YR SUBSCRIPTION.",3
"I love this magazine,  especially the recipes,  gardening tips and home design.  I've subscribed to it for years and am glad to have access to it on my kindle.",4
They are scam artist. They will send you the book and it does not matter if you ordered it.  And charge you.  Buyer beware!,0
Lots of interesting info,3
Their published facts and figures are usually wrong.  Even when I contacted them with the proper data they just ignored me.  It is not a reputable magazine in my opinion.,0
Great deal and quick service. I renewed this from last year with Amazon. Best deals on amazon.com for magazine subscriptions,4
it won't open. it says that its on another device.. this is the only kindle i own. DONT PURCHASE.IT DOES NOT WORK.,0
Would like to cancel,0
"Wish I could write more but no magazine ,no correspondence other that this review request as sescriber I have yet to receive one magazine stone cold nothing.",0

"Kids love these additions, great addition to the non-fiction bin.",3
"I haven't even gotten it yet, I see the new issue out but mines not here..very disapointed. I should have it by now.",0
what a terrible magazine.,0
This publication seems to focus more on real estate ads than critical reviews of those locations we might be interested in.,0
"If you are someone who actually cooks, you'll enjoy this.",3
I'm a wedding photographer who loves finding new inspiration for my future events. Martha Stewart weddings has some of the best visuals I've seen by far.,4
"articles are just okay, needs more funny content, always buy magazines on amazon though, best price you can find anywhere.  very few pages, thin magazine",3
I attempted to download the magazine for 2 days.  I gave up and cancelled my subscription.  Not all of my money was refunded.  So much for a 30 day FREE trial.,0
Good magazine with content that is relevant and displays well on the Kindle.,3
Not happy.  Almost every page has advertisement.  Lots have all advertisements 3 pages in a row.  What has happened to Family Circle?  Will not be renewing.,2
I am waiting for the next issue before I grade it again.  This one was a little different than is my style of cooking.,2
Got the bag no magazine though,1
Articles about how to lose weight?  How to attract a guy? Celebrity gossip?  Is it really healthy to let a 10 yr old girl read this?  NO!!!!,0

I have enjoyed every issue so far.",4
mostly advertisements,2
awesome great happy buy again and another thirteen words are required for the product awesome great happy buy again awesome great happy buy again,4
The smart phone format is too small. Can't read half the articles. If they switched to a kindle format ( I love my Atlantic Monthly on smart phone) then I might stay with it.,0
Great magazine with both recipes and foodie articles. A lot of info packed into a magazine anyone who wants to learn more about cooking or simply likes to cook will love!,4
My FAVORITE magazine. I love to read and learn more about cooking. This is a great publication for any level of cook.,4
Not a lot of content. OK for $5.00.,2
Love Martha and this a great deal,4
Fluff and ads.,1
I have had Texas Monthly for 3 years now. Almost every issue has multiple great stories. My only complaint is the amount of multiple page ads (travel guides) in it every week.,3
It always has a couple of practical recipes. I wish there were more variety; the realistic kitchen isn't healthy 365 days a year. A couple of the stories were interesting.,3
Less than 6 issues for 1 year subscription.,0
The best source for health!,4
"I'm sure I will love the magazine, but I still haven't received it. That is the reason for the 1 star rating.",0
There are an amazing amount of tobacco ads in this magazine. I expected better content.,1

I wasn't too crazy about these magazines. Just didn't keep my interest. too bad.,1
"Great magazine but as other reviews have said, the print is pretty small.",3
"This magazine is enjoyable and has a lot of research behind it, though somewhat repetitive because of the advertising factor.",2
I liked the old Allure style much better.  These models not so attractive to look at.  Allure's articles on beauty products always very good.,2
Not much in the magazine anymore,2
I was not disappointed with this publication.  I look forward to each issue with great anticipation.,4
Great pictures and articles.,3
awesome rag.,4

"Great magazine to catch up on the current news with, but I do miss it in paper-form.",3
I have only recieved two magazines and have had it for almost a year! Waste of money!!,0
This is truly an unexpected Gem.  I found wonderful ideas on how to decorate my home from this magazine.  Really reminds you that a home is more than four walls and lot of stuff.,4
I especially like the crossword puzzles.,3
The cost of a two month for $150 and only mon - fri is crazy. I will not be reordering this paper again. What a rip off,0
This is a great magazine if I was younger in age!,0
I have been using this magazine for years. I especially like the meditations. The ebook version is easy  to use because the meditations follow the Mass readings.,4

stupid magazine I cancelled but never got a refund,0
so overwhelming...,0
The issues come sporadically. I've missed several.,0
Lots of interesting content.  Always timely.,4
The publication usually has an article or two worth reading but for the most part is filled with advertisements. Cancelled my subscription before the year was out.,0

Needs more content for the price.,2
Decent fashion magazine.,2
"Just using the printed issues - the old fashioned way. Followed the intructions clearly and it would not work.  Also, Vogue is just not as good as it used to be 1980-2000.",1

"My favorite.  Full of useful info, great format, outstanding in every way.  Wish I could live my life using Martha's calendar...",4
My husband looks forward to receiving every issue.,4
"I like this magazine.  I think that some of the stuff they do wouldn't work on a small budget, but I like to see how they put things together then try to recreate it for cheaper.",2
My girl loves to take the quizzes and read the articles about what girls her age have done to make the world a better place. Great!,4
Some good articles--too much filler for my preference.,2
Not worth it now that  Flat Earther Murdock bought it.,0
I have not even received the ordered item and it was ordered over a month ago.  Kinda tough to rate or get excited about it.,0
Best reading for adventure drama humor educational and for mysteries and stimulating the mind and at a great price. Thank you amazon,4
Absolutely my favorite magazine!!,4

This is an exceptional way of following the horticultural world in the UK.  It also has a wealth of plant-specific gardening tips,4
"It has nice content but out of 230 pages, 113 were ads. That's not even counting the smaller ones. I won't be renewing.",2

I guess cooking light means cooking yuk.  I haven't found one recipe in months that I would even bother to make.  Frankly they can't stop send this magazine soon enough.,0
Not as good as I hoped it would be. I'm more of a technical person so only one issue so far has kept my interest. The WIRED email articles I get are usually more interesting.,2
A few good articles on finding a job. Almost nothing really all that helpful in the money Dept. Seemed like a lot of whining about things that aren't silver plattered.,1
Way to much adds. But I like the information.,2
Price was way too high but everyone else's was too.,2
Nice magazine to give as a gift and easy to send via amazon. My friends love it And I like sending it,3

Great reading,4
"Too much advertising, not what I expected",2
"If you want to know what's going on in our great state, this is your magazine!  My son loves getting it!",4

The new issue was released this past Friday. It is now Monday! Where is the newest issue? This is rather annoying,1
"It certainly loses quite a bit of appeal without pictures, but the articles are short and interesting just the same.",2
It's too bad that they have succumed to pushing the leftist political agenda. It used to be a great magazine. I'm not renewing my subscription.,1
Very interesting reading but recipes were a little too complicated for me and I didn't get very good result when I tried them. I need something quicker to use.,2
I love reading this mag. They really find new authors and even from different country's .,4
Our granddaughter is thoroughly enjoying the magazine..... looks forward to getting it in the mail each month and loves the activities!,4
I've had a subscription since 2000. Love this magazine.,4
Used to buy this magazine years ago and loved all the tips. Unfortunately now instead of a lot of great ideas it is mostly advertisements.,1
Fast and easy service. The young man that received National Geographic as a gift loves it and reads the magazine more than once.,4
About 20% of the magazine is interesting/helpful. Some good point of views.,3
I expected much more. Too expensive for a kindle version. Needs so much improvement  . I was advised not to get it. Bad choice,0
I still have not rec'd my subscription.....!,0
Long time fan of this magazine,3
Great...enjoying digital mag already...great price!,4
I ordered my Oprah magazine subscription a month ago now. I still haven't recieved my first issue. Still waiting......,0
"Not very impressed, at least with my first issue. Too many ads, not enough recipes. Will post an update when the next one arrives.",1
"I ordered a six month trial version and the very next month they made me renew for the additional year.  A bit too pushy for me, I will not do this again!",0
Love it! Great price!,4
Not much real info. Too much crunch with little actual substance,0
I have subscribed to this magazine for several years now and it is always a good read.  Lots of great features and quite a good price.,4
I also have not received my TV Guide.  Bought it for my husband as one of his Christmas gifts.  Oh well.....lesson learned.,0
Kindle version no longer available,1
Love the website and the Mag is even better!,4
About 50% ads.,2
Don't waste your money on this and if you do remember their is an auto renewal.,0
I buy this magazine for an inmate who dreams of winning a poetry contest and having his poetry published. He loves it!,4
"Don't always find something I can use, but still enjoy perusing.",2

It did not come with a clutch as stated.,0
Backpacker is one of the greatest magazines out there for the ones who love outdoors,4
"Love the ideas in the magazine and the recipes, too.",4
Awesome magazine.  Wish we had Life Time Fitness in my town.,4
I like it very much.  Loses one star for the political bias in the puzzles.  :-),3
A little much for me - technical sort of.  I'm more or less a beginner in this.  At least  I gave it a chance.,2
Not happy with this magazine.  there were 17 adds for meds and so much advertisement.... not much interest here.  i would NOT order it again!,0
good financial information,3
"cannot read the print too small
I cannot do mags on kindle",0
TIME MAG is great ... but ... I'd prefer a PDF version instead of this interactive one. Or have the choice.,0
"This is one of my favorite magazine.  Wonderful ideas.
I would pick up this magazine at many offices and it got me hooked.",4
Pretty photography.  But this type of magazine is just not my cup of tea.  I'm sure others will love it.,1
Too esoteric,1
"A good magazine, easy to read and some good recipes. Not sure if I will resubmit another year. Not sure if it is worth the price for what you get.",2
It cannot even compare to it's former self.  I have saved stacks of Women's Days from the 70s and 80s.  I will not save one of these issues - nothing worthwhile.,0
"Comes quickly. Great prices on here vs.anywhere else. New Englander who loves this for years. Give it to family or friends who no longer live in New England, they'll love it.",4
Full of garbage advertisement to do franchise. There quality keeps going down like CNN. Now it is straight garbage.,0
Just like current history I cannot navigate this publication on my Amazon fire tablet,0
doesn't read like a magazine but separate stories from a magazine. too different for me to accept.,2
"Doesnt really work, I guess I didn't read the fine print about what type of op system it works with, but I love vogue so I just ignore the kinks and keep it moving!",2
DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! PUBLISHER HAS FOLDED AND THE FINAL ISSUE IS ALREADY AT NEWS STANDS!!!!!!!!,0

"Love this magazine - lots of colorful pictures and great articles of far away places.  If you love learning about other cultures, read this magazine, written in friendly language.",4
I love Guidepost.,4

Some interesting reading ..,3
"My 6 year old looks forward to getting her magazine every month - very colorful, full of information and she really enjoys it!",4
"Somehow this great magazine has fallen down when it comes to interesting articles...I will not be renewing my subscription, sorry to say.",0
This is by far 1 of my favorite magazines.  I usually read it front to back and an added treat is all the coupons that are in every issue.,4
"Magazine full of advertisements, won't renew my subscription.",0
Love this large print.  It is so much easier to read.  I always liked Reader's Digest and this large print makes it so much better.,4
Through academic subscription I can get the print copy delivered for $75. This quoted price for an electronic version is outrageous.,0
"I am frustrated that I get an online subscription with my print subscription, but I must pay for it to use it in my Kindle Fire.",2
"I am just beginning my journey into art quilts.  This magazine has been such an inspiration and reassurance that I too, can create interesting art quilts.",4
some interesting stuff.,3
But the price is nuts! At least with the print version I can clip articles pass it along and take to my library when I am done.,0
Never received any issues of this magazine yet,0
Far more ads than they used to have. Wish there had been more actual content,2
"The best magazine out there for those who want simple ideas on decorating, meal making, re-use, gardening, etc.  I LOVE everything about this zine. Highly recommend!",4
I still have not received my first issue and it's been 2 months since I placed the order.,2
I love this magazine (5 Stars) and was hoping to get it via the PC Kindle app but NOT available (0 Stars) Average 2 stars.,1
First magazine I received...pictures were all dull and depressing. Hoping there will be more color in future issues.,2
Long shipping time and high price.,2
Good magazine....great trails,3
mom loves it..,4
I ordered this magazine over a month ago and I'm still waiting for the 1st issue to arrive!,0
Great mag. but not suitable to read on tablet.,3
"Nice read, but it has gotten much smaller. It used to take me a few hours to read this, now it is maybe an hour.",3

More a political rag mag now.",1
My son likes this he doesn't love it. There are a fair amount of ads and it is hard for him to read alone.,3

"A gift for my daughter who is a huge fan of Country Living magazine.  So am I, for that matter.  A great purchase!",4

I agree that this company is one to avoid.  Here is their toll free number.. someone actually does answer it... (877)893-7885.,0

"This is one magazine I simply can't live without.  Great places to go, wonderful decorating, recipes to save and the gardening is my favorite.",4
Too much advertisement,1
Limited (boring) articles; too many advertisements; worthless. I will not renew.,0
"Nice colourful mag but just shows off the new bikes, no repairs or mods.",2
"Not as centric as some, and not as dogmatic in the article approach to firearms.

Did auto renew because I like it.",3
"I purchased this magazine for my step daughter, she loves getting it; it's something she looks forward to each month...",4
"The magazines are great, but I never received the golf shoe bag that was supposed to accompany my subscription...",0
I wish they had more articles about cigar and their history. I'm new to the world of cigars,2
Ok not great,2
I'm concerned that I wasn't given the opportunity to register a change of address at the same time as the extension was automatically effected.,0

I love that I see so much of my style and personality in BHG!,4
my 12 year old prefers popular science,1
Love this magazine except Traditional is no longer so traditional.  If it continues to change towards modern they should change the title.,2
I don't even remember ordering this magazine so I can not give it a review.  I am not interested in this couple or what they are doing.  I would remember ordering I am sure.,0
"More materialistic than anything, not an accurate portrayal of the average yogis world. Needs more substance and less ads",2
Not worth the money! Haven't read anything I couldn't on the internet.,0
"Reupped my subscription. Really enjoy this magazine, and love the kindle version that comes with the subscription. A must for the watercolor artist.",4

"will never order again,i am going to cancel it....its all advertisements!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!dont waste your money, nothing informative,not even alot of country homes or decor",0
Good to keep up on New products and services. Editors do an excellent job of covering all phases of boating.,3
I just received the first issue of a full years subscription and never received another one again.  This is a rip off,0
"Subscribed to this magazine and after receiving many issues, I'm not the least bit impressed.  It's a very slim magazine with very little in it.",1
Eh... kind of interesting.  The LP is going in the toilet a bit so I'm losing interest.  Probably unfair to penalize Reason for that though.,2
For Hubby--not to my taste,2
"This was a very good price for a very good magazine.  I saved $3 - $5 over

Food Babe? Really? This magazine is garbage. Don't bother.,0
"Very good content, but too expensive.",3
Too many ads.  I feel like this is nothing but a magazine for marketing.  Seems like over half the pages were ads for realtors or doctors.  Rich wanting to be richer.  Nice!,1
"I've been subscribing for years and love the variety of articles, recipes and insights.",4
I doubt you will publish my review since I have not received a single copy after several months.  I will be very reluctant to buy again.,0

"My husband loves the outdoors, hunting, fishing, etc. This magazine is perfect for him!!!",4
I Love the additional thoughts added to the daily mass readings.  A great way to start my day and easy to pull up on my phone or iPad!!,4
"I ordered this before Christmas and although other subscriptions that were ordered at the same time have started delivery, I have not yet received a single issue.",1
I expected more information on muzzleloaders instead of advertisements.  I have been shooting muzzleloaders for over 35 years so I guess i set my expectations too high.,1

"Always liked this magazine. Used to get the hardcopy, but now I have a kindle so I get cycle world electronically.",3
"Handy to have both version,s but honestly one or the other would suffice. I haven't had a situation where I had one and used the same issue of the other.",3
Says over 2 dozen patters per issue but the first issue I got has 16 and the format is terrible as that page only fills 2/3 of the screen. Patterns are mostly nice.,2

I know she really enjoys it and is commenting on many of the articles.",3
"The subscription  started a month earlier than I was told, which was great...",3

The format makes it hard to read. I had not read for several years and the articles are not as informative as in years past.,0
We enjoy skimming the magazine to get decoration ideas for our house. Some of the ideas presented are interesting! If you are looking for ideas you might enjoy this magazine.,2
Magazine would be more enjoyable to read if you  could just pick it up and skim through it without having to hunt up the bifocals.,2
I WAS NEVER WAS ABLE TO DOWNLOAD IT ON MY KINDLE..  YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE.. CAN SOMEONE PHONE ME AND TELL ME HOW?  203 464 2165,0

Grandson love the magazine but is on the edge of moving up to the adult magazine.,3

"I have not yet received one magazine yet.  Ordered Dec 1, 2009.  Other magazines ordered the same day have arrived.",1

Quality Magazine with lots of good ideas. Wish it had more easy to sew ideas or old clothes modification design ideas.,2
Why is a hard copy subscription $10/year and the e version 1.50/month.  Seems backwards to me. Shouldn't the e version be less expensive.  No mailing etc.,0

It seems like I'm missing the  January issue... i like yoga journal kindle version but want to receive what I paid for.,2

Such a great buy! Very happy with the oodles of recipes!,4
"The articles were good and they were interesting.  They were written
to a British audience, with a limited appeal for Americans.",2

and there is no one to report to

Now I receive a renewal notification and I would not renew
becaust of this.",0
We love Nat. Geo.  Happy to get subscription thru Amazon.,4

Good informative magazine.,3
Delivered quickly and has beautiful patterns.,4
had to cancel,0
"Lots of good tips, worth the subscription",2
Good publication,3
It has a lot of adds,2
Not for me. Much prefer the actual magazine,1
a wonderful magazine has lots of informative articles and coin pricing listings.,1
too many advertisements. It was hard to find an article to read.,1
Just another magazine with tons of advertising and very little information.,2
All ads and not impressed at all with photos or articles. Cancelled the subscription right away. Not worth the money.,0
Tried purchasing this as a gift - unavailable. On the phone for 30 minutes to find this out. Heading to Barned & Noble - frustrated.,0
Mostly high priced ads. Im a new Santa Fe resident. Dont need to see ads for multi-million dollar homes. Wont renew.,0
"Got this two years in a row for my sis in law. She is obsessed with cooking and her, so it is always a hit and for 20 bucks how can you go wrong.",3
IT HAS GOOD SECTIONS,3
Great source of healthy eating alternatives.  Well thought out recipes and reviews of food/produce.,3

cheaper version of cooks illustrated magazine and has more down to earth meals with ingredients that I have in my kitchen,3

I am dumber for having looked at this.,0
"Love this magazine, and the price was right!",4
Wonderful magazine!!,4
Awesome quick. No paper to deal with. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!,4
I have always enjoyed the articles in here and am always sharing ideas with friends so I like what the subscription brings to the table.,3
"Pro: Was only $5 for a year.

Con:  Not family friendly enough for a waiting room in my opinion and too much liberal clap trap.",2
This mag is a total waste of paper. One month is just a copy of the previous month with a different cover,0
I love this publication because the patterns are stylish and up-to-date. I save every magazine and refer back to them when I'm looking for a new project.,4
Just not as good since they switched to single-themed issues. Liked it much better before,2
"It had very few vegetarian dishes. Seemed to me focused on dairy and meat, they sound like they're being paid to support the industry.",2
It was kind of a turn off this publication leaned to far left a couple of times. I wish they would stick with lifestyle and less with politics.,1
"Is not more interactive, no more links. I used to love this magazine.",0
"I can not rate the subscription yet, because I will not get it they say until June 2014. You would think they could get it out a little sooner then almost four months.",2
I hate it!  I couldn't get past the first 3 pages which were all pages geared to sales.  I plan to cancel my subscription.,0
One of the best magazine for world news.,4
Love it! Especially on my kindle!,4
This magazine is awesome and I love that amazon auto renews it for me. My subscription just keeps going. It's great!,4
Advertisements overflow,0
"I had a subscription for over 25 years, this is THE aviation magazine, every pilot should have it. Read it cover to cover.",4

So far every issue of O Magazine has been filled with alot of interesting articles and great advice.  I look forward to receiving it every month.,4

It is certainly not the Women's Day that we purchase in the shops was not impressed just pages and pages of advertisements no stories,0

Wonderful and wise way to make the right choices in an infinite cultural space of talented writers.,4
have many good ideas for my life. Thanks.,3

Articles are not relevant to me as I am eighty years old and do not live in the U.S. anymore.,2

I am a magazine junkie at heart so I am stoked that I can now take my magazines anywhere without having all of the bulk,4
We are rebuilding a 1985 Jeep. This has been the best source of information and answers a lot of questions.,4

Gender is NOT a social construct. This has turned into a liberal rag,0

Love readers digest!,4
Nothing but ads.  My daughter really didn't like it at all.,0
"Too any advertisements, not enough recipies.",1
"Its okay, but not much content - mostly what was worn where by whom.  Not so much as ""what happened.""  Who did what.",2
"There are some articles that are not so new to some of us, but once in a while there is something interesting that keeps me paying this mag's subscription.",3
DIDNT LIKE,2
Got the first. Then it stopped been delivered!,2
Ordered in December and was told the subscription would not start until MARCH. Seems like an unusually long delay. Wish I had shopped around for a different distributor,0
Still has a lot of process food options - would like more non-process - organic ideas.,3
I have received one issue of this magazine and like it so far.  The casual style of the decorating appeals to me.  I am enjoying the articles also.,3
"this is a beautiful magazine.  Seems to be written for the rich and famous and their designers.  Enjoy the pics, but not very useful for the average, retired and downsized person.",2
Even though this item promises to renew your current subscription you will still be charged by ESPN. I'm still trying to get my money back.,0
Mr granddaughter in-law just loves this magazine.,4
Print is too smal,3
"Love,love,love this magazine!!",4

What can I say?  I love this magazine.  Full of lots of information for any handyman ... you do not have to be an expert.,4
"What a disappointment; don't waste your money, as it's 90% ads.  A shadow of the 1980's/90's publication.  Two thumbs down :(",0
This magazine has been the most helpful for me  in my writing career. I love the helpful articles it holds.,4
"Unfortunately, this magazine now has more advertisements than true content and article of interest.",0
The articles were informative and the photos and layout interesting.  It is pertinent to the new interest in smaller dwelling places.,3
I'm yet to receive a magazine or a free clutch. Terrible.,0
Won't download to my kindle fire. Disappointed!! Please  discontinue my subscription I won't pay for another year!,0
More Ads than magazine. A little disappointed.,2
Has some relivant topics. I'm always interested in hearing about IRA's and 401k's. Good reading for the novice.,3

"Coastal Living  is a great read!
I have gotten it for many years and love it. Living in Hawaii is as coastal as it gets!
Hula Girl",4

Love this magazine.  Great recipes and great ideas.,4
"I have not received anything from this magazine yet.  According to past reviews, they are very slow at starting the subscription and I guess thats correct.",0

"Excellent graphic design and well-written, concise stories.",4
Love this magazine and couldn't beat the price.,4
"i love this magazine, and i like ordering it through amazon, get points to shop with.  Great decorating ideas, great recipes and articles",4

This is actually a gift for my mother. I've never read an issue. She seems to like it though.,3
"The Magazine is great, nevertheless my physical address was lacking information the senders (POPULAR SCIENCE) so, I only received 4 issues of a 1 year subscription.",0
If is possibly I assign 0 stat. The diagramation and graphics are a shame. I feel very disappointed that amazon offer a magazine for kindle in such low standard.,0
Loved it .. especially the articles on fashion.,3
"Did not order this, I hate magazines.",0
Nice magazine to keep up with what is going on in Texas. Nice travel guide around Texas also.,3
Very redundant from month to month...thought it would be more interesting but it literally just feels like every page is advertising something.,1
"Bar none, the best business magazine on the planet. Not ever an easy read, but always full of valuable insights and ideas. Well worth the price tag IMO.",4
My daughter love's it,4
to much advertisments,1
Magazine is ok.  Seems like the ads are more numerous than the articles.,4
"I love this magazine and have subscribed for many, many years.  Highly recommended!",4
Best fitness magazine if you want facts and helpful articles that revolve around health and well being (instead of empty nonsense),4
They are some interesting articles even though the magazine is very flat.,3

I love this magazine. Great articles and stories.,4
"Yes, with great photos and info.",3
I love this magazine.  Especially when it gives towns to visit.,4

"Today is February 12, 2010.  I ordered this December 15, 2009.  Have never received the first copy--when can I wxpect it?",0

Love this mag !,4
Enjoy the online edition.,3
Not enough DIY projects to rate higher.,2
"Vogue is my Bible. I learned to shoot fashion from Vogue and its great photographers. Vogue is a classy magazine, well edited, and with terrific art direction.",4
"I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and we both love it! I am very happy with the purchase!",4
Been getting this magazine for probably 30 years. Enjoy the stories but sometimes the programming is wrong especially with PBS.,3
I order magazines for our medical office. We try to keep magazines that appeal to both men and women. The Reader's Digests are by far the most popular.,4
The best in the industry.,4
"Clever, hip cutting edge magazine for anyone who cares about writing.",3
Cannot read on Kindle Fire because the issue does not zoom out to enlarge.  I would give it zero stars!,0
I didn't really want to read them. Daydreaming over the pictures was just enough..it's an ok mag. Just not my kinda thing.,1
"Have bought this magazine for years. My boys love looking at the movie ratings in this magazine. Easy reading and it comes weekly, so everything you are reading is current",4
It's a magazine....it's ok....I bought it for reference because it was recommended to me by someone else.  Not my style though.,2
Ratio of advertising to articles and ideas is 15-1.  So sad.,1
"Great content, but Kindle format is no good.  Kindle formar too hard to use for magazines.  This mag needs its own app, like the excellent Business Week app.  Am returning it.",0
Good reading material. I look forward to each new copy.,3
I have always loved this magazine and getting it on the Fire is awesome!!,4

Every issue is great.",4
"My favorite thing to read! So many interesting articles on a wide variety of subjects, in addition to wonderful insightful book reviews.",4

Not nearly as good as it used to be.  I would say it has about half the content it once had.,2
To expensive,0
"One for my favorite magazines.  I love all the articles.  Good ideas on decorating, etc.,",4
Excellent..,4
I received like 5 bridal magazines the first month- haven't seen a new one in months.,2

Not very good.,0
IPad version was worthless.,0
"thought my 6 year old would like it, boy was I wrong.",0
"It is hard to review a magazine that I have yet to receive even though it was order 12/04/2005.  Please let me know when I can expect to receive my 1st issue,",0
"Clearly, a magazine that would give credence to a liar, fraud, and ""organic"" shill like Vani Hari, is not a magazine that aims to bring any truth or knowledge to its readers.",0
Pleasant articles by distinguished writers indicates a consistent joy to the reader.,3
Husband loves it!,4

"I love it.  I live in L.A. and really need to know what's going on, and this magazine gives me everything.",4
Much smaller than I imagined it would be. More of a pamphlet than a magazine. But my kids like the pictures.,1
My favorite Ski Magazine. The Best.,4
There are a lot of advertisements. Almost every other page was filled with a full page ad or just a product placement.,1
"My granddaughter loves this magazine. My daughter is reading it to her, daily. Ziggy always gives it to her mom so she can read it to her.",3
Still cannot access account. Very disappointed. Wish Amazon or publisher would make this right for me.,0
You'll get more scientific fact from The National Enquirer. No thanks!,0
I renewed this magazine for my daughter.  She loves all the fashion magazines and the price on this couldn't be beat (2 years for $7.00),4
"I love this magazine! I've owned my 4runner for 16 years & I'm not interested in other mags with Ford, Chevy, Jeep etc...
Only reliable Toyota's!",4

Great magazine at a great price.,4
This is really the best gift for people who love the outdoors.,4
I didn't buy this piece of crap!,0
Really - how should I know since it takes two months for the first issue to arrive!,0

"I prefer Classic Bike, maybe because I lean towards old, Brit Bikes. I've only seen 1 issue, perhaps the next ones will be more to my liking.",2
Best magazine on the market,4

Magazine is good not sure how to do crosswords and no instructions given,2
"Magazine is great, haven't received tote bag yet.  10-5-15",3
over priced trash,0
Some of the topics / articles don't relate to a 10 year old (4th grader going into 5th grade),2
magazines may have gone digital but that makes their ads even more annoying--it takes way too long to get to the stories and by then I don't want to read it.,0
Very nice a lot of ideas,3
not good.,0
Love the magazine. I've been a subscriber for over 20 years. It's content is on point for today's Black woman.  Essence keep up the good work.,4
"I love the New Yorker, but the Kindle version leaves much to be desired in terms of presentation and navigation.",2
Was hoping to get tuned into men's fashion but this just has a lot of stuff I'm not personally interested in.,1
I already have The New Yorker Print & Digital subscription. Why do I need to pay again for a subscription on my Kindle Voyage?! Completely unacceptable.,0
I would reccomend this Woman's Day to my Mom and sisters.  Woman's Day has a variety of subjects that entertain you for hours.,3
My best friend's best ever gift..so good I renewed for another birthday!!!,4

Not the magazine that it use to be.  Not southern cooking.,1
"Everybody knows this is one of the must-have magazine subscriptions if you care about culture, wildlife, or the environment. I read them all cover-to-cover.",4
I have not gotten it yet.  Could review if I saw it.  Please let me know if/when it is coming.,0
cancelled this item,0
"To much advertising,  please cancel",0
Not worth 46 cents an issue.  It's a political rag.  There are just too many shiny pages that I can't use to wipe my butt with.,0
Full of shoe and video game ads.  Not much content.  Content is low quality.,0
One of my favorite cooking magazines.,4
my lady loves this magazine,4
"This magazine blows, feels like its written for retired 60 somethings who live in florida. This magazine needs a re-work and a younger voice!",0
This is the 9nly magazine I read front to back. Love!,4
do not want,0
Magazine content will only be delivered to iphones and andriods. I don't have those so I sort of just made a $6 donation. Don't buy digital magazines.,1
This is a very dependable AP for my kindle fire.  Magazine always looks good and is easy to navigate.  I just find that I forget about it for weeks a time.,3
Changed there formate.greared for younger reader. Not as good as it housed to be,2
"This magazine is slightly sensationalized, but I still enjoy receiving it and reading it over time.  I research all the ideas they put forth before I believe them!!!!",3

First time.. There are too many advertisements and not enough pictures and content... so far..,2

"The best in pop literature ever it has everything movies,tv,books,podcast you name it it has it.",4

Too much advertisement.  The articles are good however would like more articles and less advertsing. Received two issues not a year's worth.,2
Yay daughter loved this magazine.  She looks forward to future issues.,4
"Not bad. a bit too thin, but not bad for the price.",3
Just received my January issue and it seems to have a lot less pages than it did before.  It was only $5 for the year but won't be renewing it when the year is up.,1
Too many advertisements,1
"I have not been able to read the magazine, because it states, ""Your magazine download is in progress.""",0
I am shocked by the number of cigarette ads in the magazine. This prevents me from enjoying it and it also does not allow me to give it to my children or others to enjoy.,0

I purchased it for my husband for Father's Day and he loves it!,4
"Great magazine, lots of ideas and comments about everyday matters.  The recipes are simple which is a help for non original cooks like me.",3
This is a great magazine.  My husband is from South Carolina and he misses it terribly.  This is just what he needed to keep him in touch with his roots!!!,4
I like them.,3
Nice range of articles chosen in  the magazine...a breeze to read on the kindle without the ads. I was skeptical in the beginning but I read 3 articles at 1 go.,3
Not my kind of travel. Too spendy.,2
A once-great journal has joined the vapid heard & now sells the same shallow narrative as all the rest. May it Rest In Peace.,0
My favorite magazine filled with inspiration.,4
Changed my address and it STILL went to the old address. Furious for my $19 going down the drain.,0
Love my O magazine subscription!,4
It turns out I never have time to watch TV so this was a useless purchase for me. If you have time to watch TV and want to know what's on then this is the purchase or you!,1
I don't even miss the paper.  It is a great version.  My only complaint is that it does not appear in the kindle newsstand as easily as others.,3
90% advertisements,1
It was cool or whatever,2
Will not order again received 1 got some kink of small rebate around $15. Never again,0
"My 3 year old grandson loves the Highlights High Fives. He looks forward to the mail coming so he can ""read"" it with his Mom!",4

"I've been waiting over a month and have yeti to get the first issue. Although I'm eager for it, it's annoying to be asked to review a product I've yet to receive.",0
I like this magazine for primitives and country home design or decorative ideas. The magazine also has links and sites listed so that you are able to purchase these items.,3
"it does not come regularly. In fact, i have only received 3 when i should have gotten about 6 so far.",0
I'm not a quilter but my daughter loves it and asks to have it renewed each year. A nice gift that gives all year.,3
More of an entertainment magazine than I was expecting.,2
"Magazine is ok, but has more advertisements than articles",0
"Too many rifles, but is good value these days for mostly advertising.",2
The magazine is great. But the clutch was landfill. More like something you'd receive at a nail polish promotion.,2

 Lately, it has become nothing more than a platform to promote the radical socialist agenda of Obama.",0
All adds. Where the hell are the articles?,2

"Disappointed.  Way too many advertisements.
We own a vintage beach house. I was hoping for more articles on average coastal homes and towns. Not just high dollar properties.",1
"Magazine ok, but they automatically renewed it and charged my card. Did not want to renew...went on line and would not let me cancel!",0

Too many advertisements not enough content.,0

"I am a ""handywoman"" and I love looking at the hints and projects in this magazine ---makes me even more creative and happy with my tools !",4
good price when on sale. Its for my wife.,3
"We have not received this magazine yet, as of today (2/11/10) it has been 10 weeks.",0
Not sure if it's my iPad or the mag but does Not seem to be interactive like other magazines. There are play buttons but nothing happens when I push them...,2
Awesome magazine! Wished they did 12 mags a year :(,4
"Basically ""Cosmo"" for men. Won't buy again. About 25% of it is worth reading, but I have better things to read.",1
"Not received mail version and cannot access digital version, frustrating.",0
"Nat. Geo is amazing, always! Beautiful pictures, quality articles.  Never a waste of time. You will always learn from every single issue.",4
"The best Newspaper in the USA, hands down!!",4
"The magazine does not have much information. Taken out advertisement, you have just a few pages of news. Big disappointment. Waste of money.",2
first and last subscription. too pricy,2
Love this magazine. It was a great price.,4
First off you get it after it hits the news stands which is annyoing. Secondly why can't you just do a yearly subscription? Don't recommend at all,1
Still a good mag. Petzal is great. But it seems like it's mostly an advertisement for overpriced gear.,3
Never got all of my magazines,1
cancelled,2
I have subscribed to Woman's World for 2 years now and love every issue.  Good information and great stories.,4
When I ordered mag it did not state no disc.,2
Was disappointed .  Contest let them use Photoshop.  I thought a good photographer did it all with camera settings.,0
AWESOME!!  The best magazine on the planet!!,4
I love receiving my weekly issue.,4

Wife has always loved W Magazine and this was a great price. Happy.,4

It has been well past when my order should have arrived with no luck,0

it was a gift.  but i love the magazine.,3
He didn't receive his July/ August issue. Other than that he loves it.,2
Practically all advertising.  Nothing like it used to be. Hardly any good articles.  I am very disappointed.,1
I have not received a single issue however I did get a card from PS saying that the delivery would begin later (more than 6 weeks) than advertised because of demand.,1
I love the helpful style tips! The photography is excellent and the writing is superb. I will be subscribing to the print version after my free online trial!,4
...mostly advertisements and very few pages.  Not like the old days when there were many recipes to try.,2
I like it!  A lot of neat ideas that can be adapted to other things. Wish it came out more often!,3
"I was very disappointed there weren't more recipes or articles in the magazine.  Also, I don't like the layout of the magazine as much as I did the layout in past issues.",2
It was just okay. After reading the one issue I've determined that I would much rather have the actual magazine. In the electronic version you can't do the crossword :),2
"Tons of ads and multiple covers, hoping you'll buy the magazine twice while in a hurry.
Very little professional content.",0
I have a problem with the service. We relieved only two magazines In a year time. Where did the other ones go?,0
Love the different food genres,3

It's great to have Cooking Light on my Kindle!  It's so much easier than using the magazine.  Less messy--don't you think!,4
"One of the Best prices I could find,delivery has been perfect.",4
"Cannot get access on line to review the magazine, even after logging the first time.  Never could get back on.",2
Mindless moronic crap for the socially insecure or narcissistic nitwit.  A gift subscription that I wouldn't wipe my ass with.  Great paper for the bottom of a birdcage....,0
I spent so much more just picking this up at the grocery store much better deal to have it mailed to me. I love my Soaps in Depth,4
Has some good stuff but not like real business magazines,2
I do love this magazine!,4

Do Not Buy,0
"I want to end the subscription, but can't see any way to do thatt. DON't BUY! You will be forever stuck.",0

"i have had this magazine before and its great, only problem is i don't get my first issue until july. thats sad.",3
This magazine had more ads than content. If print magazines are to survive they must be worth their price. thanks,0
It's useful if you want to buy tools. At least or a little more than half of articles are power tool and other contraptions reviews. I cancelled my subscription after 3 magazines.,1
"nice magazine, like the recipes",3

Disappointed.  Got my first issue and it's so hard to read because the advertisements overwhelm the articles.  And thin - not much to read.,1
I hate the fact that the magazine won't start till June while I paid in April. Seems like a deal to good  cheaper but they will bill me in April next yr 2,0

don't subscribe anymore it was ok,0
I subscribed for a year. I think I recieved a total of two copies and am now recieving notices to renew my subscription. NOT !!!!,0
Lots of learning opportunities for any age reader.  I do not approve of some of the ads for young readers in our school library.,2
Too much ads,0

Ordered this for my junior high library.  Girls love it and can't beat the price!  The eagerly anitcipate the next issue's arrival!,4
Have paid for it but have yet to received it?????????????????????????????? Please check into it and let me know the status!,0
Too many times they refer you to the website to get a recipe or additional news.  Why buy the magazine if they do that?,2

My husband is the head of a college Automotive Technology department.  He's read all of the mags put out there for auto enthusiasts and loves this one by far.,4

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Unless you really like to collect rehashed videos from other Avena Lee videos...but why do that?!,0

Reptiles Magazine is hands-down the best monthly reptile publication. And Amazon has the best price! Win-win!,4
I don't like Texas Monthly.  Never have.  Some people want it just 'cause it's about Texas but it's not worth it.  Read somebody else's copy.,0

A gift for my Mom.  Great price!,4
This is garbage I don't know one company that takes two months to deliver. I'm sorry this is unacceptable. what a waste.,0
Far too many advertisements and a lot of the info pertains to people with rheumatoid arthritis but I have gotten enough out of it to continue to subscribe.,2
too paritisan. I don't need someone to persuade me. I can make up my own mind. I want both sides of an issue. I will give it another couple of weeks.,0
I bought this for my sister and it came with auto-renewal.  Now I can't work out how to cancel the subscript.,0
The subscription his news stands tuesday and i receive it on friday some Saturday. Not good for me.  It would be good to receive it wednesday at tbursday the latest.,0

Some nice choices for recipes but not things we store in our pantry or fridge on a regular basis.,2
Fantastic read,4
I ordered a subscription for my dad.  My dad told me that it was just a magazine full of ads and sports articles.  Apparently popular mechanics means ads and sports.,0

Nice but not what I was looking for.,1

There were not many good articles in here.,1
"Beautiful photography! Love the artwork, covers and articles. Channeling my inner ranch hand and dreaming of fantasy ranch property. Even the ads are pretty.",4
"This mag is losing it high quality of yesteryear. Trying to keep up with the trends of stoopid young people is just that, a trend, not longevity.",2
Don't know what I was expecting but this wasn't it. I am hoping the next issue is better.,2
Too many Ads  will not purchase again!,1
My son and I can't wait for the next issue each month.  Highly recommend if you're into the coolest new technology being developed today.,4

It didn't meet my expectations.,0

"I still haven't received an issue yet. Said the first issue was due on jan. 7th, it is now the 27th",0
Scientifically irrefutable.  Fantastic up to date information.,4

One of the best magazines EVER!",4
Great Magazine. But for some reason only gets to our mail ox about 1/2 the time......,2
Seems like this publication has gone down hill. Not noteworthy as previous years. Reviews marginal at best.,2
"WELL I GUES THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE RIGHT... WOW HOW MANY ADS CAN YOU FIT IN THIS MAGAZINE?? I THINK 90% IS ADS, THE REST IS NOT EXACTLY THE ""POPULAR SCIENCE"" I WAS EXPECTING...",1
This has just turned into a gossip and boasting magazine. No longer seems relevant for the investor.,1

"I love, love, love TOH magazine.  I subscribe to the printed copy and also view online.to get the added features.",4

Dumb and so self serving.,0

"Many new ideas, informative....",3
A wealth of information for a great price.,4

The subscription never started.,0
I enjoyed reading the articles in this magazine. Ordering the online version was so much cheaper than buying the print version but I miss being able to tear out pages.,3
I compared this to ipad app and the physical magazine. Clumsy app and I found it difficult to navigate through the articles and know where I was.,1
Absolutely love this magazine and the make up bag is amazing. It is not cheap it's good thick material easy to clean and great size. Great deal,4
I'm unhappy with pseudo health publications that are so full of poor body image and 'fluff chick' crap. Not much here for good health support,0

"I love Analog.
I have always loved Analog. Excellent sci-fi, editorials, and I keep up with cutting edge science this way.",4
It doesnt seem like Kindle includes all the pictures. The quality of the writing seems to have declined over the years.,2
It is interesting to read and has a lot of helpful information.,3
"I've been a subscriber to BA for years, and now it will be wonderful to have my favorite magazine on my Kindle Fire.",4
Not the NG I grew up with. SUPER LIBERAL POLITICAL AGENDA written mostly by women. Mine goes right in the trash. Will not renew when it expires. Very disappointing.,0

"Time magazine has been a source of news for many years.  Great magazine.  If you want analysis and good reporting in a magazine, this is it.",4
I've looked at this magazine intermittently over the last few years and found this issue much thinner than I expected.  Perhaps future issues will have more articles per issue.,2
Can't really review-was never able to fully load it on Kindle-finally gave up. That is all I have to say -but this system needs 7 more words til I can submit review.,0
The first words in the lines of the articles were cut off. Frustrating.,1
Saw the next issue on news stand and it was full of ads compared to the one I had read.  So I cancelled it.,0

I love the digital subscription. Now I can stay up to date on my musical interest's,4
The recipes look good and seem simple enough. I have only made a few.  I usually get an idea and change it up to my liking to fit into my diet restrictions.,3
"Never even got the magazine. They sure did process my money though.

Perhaps regular readers of this magazine aren't bothered by the ads but I found that this magazine contained more advertisements than actual reading material and projects.,1
Gave this to both of my daughter in laws for Christmas.  They love it!,4
It is rediculous that an order placed on-line should take 4-6 weeks to be delivered.,1

We love this magazine,4

What a refreshing magazine. It has story's in every era.,3
Nine year old granddaughter loves this magazine!,4

I was disappointed with this magazine. It did not have many pages and the contents were not very interesting. No good recipes and mostly full of ads.,2
Love this magazine...thanks.,4
Most of the recipes are easy to follow and do not require too many specialty ingredients. I enjoyed the magazine.,3
Hugh variety of articles regarding current and historical subjects with wonderful pull-out expansion maps and pictures.  This is the best magazine on the market.,4
There's such a large emphasis on wedding dresses. The magazine is pretty much just pictures of dresses. I subscribed to 2 wedding magazines and they're both really disappointing.,1

Glad Time is back! Great magazine!,4
My favorite magazine! Lots of great info every month.,4

Love the articles about techniques and other artists.  It's also great to find out about competitions that I could enter.,4

Love this magazine. Always reviews the latest trend and I can count on Elle to introduce new designers. Thank you.,4
It's an ok magazine.  It was a good price when I purchased it.  It does take a long time for the 1st magazine to arrive.,2
Having this on my fire make storage so easy. Color pages are clear. My only complaint is the paper version is available way before the e version. It's hard to wait to read it !!!,3
I bought this as a gift for my parents. They like the publication. There only complaint is that there could be more recipes.,3
"When they say there is a version for a tablet, they mean it. Unlike Kindle for PC, it's tablet or nothing. Next time I'll take their word for it.",0

Not a magazine ...it is one big advertisement.  I had high hopes for this publication.  Stick with Traditional home or one of those.  Big disappointment.,0
Ordered it for an 11 year old horse lover and she wasn't really excited about it.,2
Not worth the money even at the discounted price . The magazine is prolific with ads and paltry on content.,0
I was happy with this app until they made recent changes.  I also lost access to all issues in library that I paid for.  NICE!!!!!,0
If you are a mechanic in mind or body you need to read this magazine. New stuff every month and insight of what is coming in the near future.,4
I'm super happy with my purchase! Thank you so much! Super fast shipping,4

Great magazine",3
I just got the iPad version of EQMM. For some reason the table of contents only fills have the iPad page. The actual stories do take up the full page. What's up?,0
Best personal finance mag on the market. Very practical and applicable to each of us!,4
High priced for a very thin paper flyer in my opinion.  This is not a bound magazine like a regular National Geographic is so I was a bit disappointed since the price is higher.,1
Not sure that I like the automatic renewal.,2
"This app needs work as it will only download the first few pages then ""gets stuck"".  Glad I only bought one issue and I will delete that.",0
"I get this for my DIL every year as part of her Christmas and every year I ask her if she would like a different magazine and every year she says no, she loves this one.",4
Most biased magazine I have ever read.,0

I sent it to my greatgran daughter  last year for Christmas and renewed it this year,3
I've loved this magazine since I started swiping copies from the school library. I was in 3rd grade.,4
I don't use the digital portion of this but LOVE the print.  I have been very impressed with the content.  I find everything very helpful and interesting.  Highly recommend.,4
Nice magazine but lessons useless without audio files which aren't included despite stating otherwise.,1
Received the first 3 issues in the mail at the same time. Will be interesting to see how the next issue come.,2
"Subscribed after some excellent cover artwork that I've not seen since. Coverage inconsistent... pro-something one month, anti same-thing the next month. Won't be renewing.",1
The magazine is great. Don't use auto-renewal. You pay full retail cover price. Wait for a deal and you can get three subscriptions for the same prive.,1
"Full articles and adds. Guess I could do without the adds, but then it would not feel like a real magazine.",3
"All of a relevant information at this time are inside , love love",4
"Aah, I like science but. Magazines are mostly advertisement. NOT ENOUGH SCIENCE.",2
I only received 3 (THREE) copies of my subscription. I fill ripped oft!,1
I ordered my subscription back in Nov and still waiting for my first issue.  Very disapointed.,0
I renew this every year for my dad for his birthday. He's building a 32' Ford from scratch. This is his favorite mag!,4

Love it!  Wish it came monthly.,3
Love to have it on my tablet!,4
Why don't they just call it the NEW WORLD ORDER magazine.  I cant believe anything in this mag.  Makes me sick.,0
"The Horse is the hands down best biker mag on the market, real bikes built by real people, I love it.",4
We are fans of science! It doesn't have as many articles as it used to have 10 years back but we still enjoy it.,3
I was bored and thought I'd buy a magazine.  I paid no attention to the price.  Not worth $4.99...not recommended,2
Such a thin magazine. Very little useful info. Truly disappointed! Martha Stewart is a master but this does not reflect her!,0
I love this magazine.  A friend gave me some of hers when I wasn't aware of this magazine.  It is an artist's best friend.,4
"I could do without all of the sappy-tear-jerker stories, otherwise good.",2
The magazine has interesting articles as long as you overlook the obvious liberal bias and BS.,3
"This was such a great deal on a guilty pleasure!  Love the magazine, and loved the price, availability through Amazon.",4
"I like southern Living, but I haven't received the 1st issue yet. Please check and see when it will begin.
Thank You",3
Tried it out with a deal of the day. Very thin 'magazine' not a lot of anything remarkable. Articles are short.,0
Good but cancelled because it is expensive,3
We love National Geographic. It is so interesting and includes beautiful photography. We re huge fans and the entire family enjoys it.,4
"Ordered as a gift for someone,they like this monthly mag",3
and it's still amazing.  love the photography.  good reading for kids in the car. can't beat the Amazon price either.  makes great gift idea too.,4

"Well-written, great design, great photography...",4
It is a wonderful magazine. I read several articles and they were very inspirational.  The magazine is beautifully illustrated and very colorful.,4

"I really like this mag, but hate the extreme number of ads.  I realize that advertising supports the mag so I just suffer through them.
The ads are why it gets only 4 stars.",3
Trying to cancel this subscription,0
The only thing I was unhappy about with regard to this order is that I was not able to cancel it - I made this particular order in error.,0
"Love it, but they stopped coming after first three issues. ",2
Mostly ads - articles are far and few,1
It has been a great magazine for us for thirty-five years.,4
Great pulp.  Get a better price by joining AOPA.  $24 for 12 issues.,3
It uis just the best magazine ever. I find it to be the most pieasurd to read. with so many articles to read about.,4

The vast majority of this magazine is ads. It's ridiculous. Total waste of money.,0
"App does not work, account gets charged without the magazine actually downloading",0
"I, also, ordered this magazine from Amazon for one year but have not received any issues.  Seems to be a recurring theme.",0
Good magazine but some better diet plans or meal planning with more recipes would make it a great monthly read,3
It is impossible to get connected to their customer service for simple address change requests. I would not recommend subscribing to Discover as a result.,0
Poorly thought out rag,0
"Love the interactive content, ie music. Brings this mag to life!",4
So far so good,3
LOVE THIS MAGAZINE!,4
"I love Real Simple magazine,, it has something for everyone and wonderful tips for doing anything better and faster and cheaper!",4

RD is still the most readable and informative magazine anywhere.  Regular delivery,4
No longer a magazine for Western home and garden. It has become a uselessly glitzy advertising piece. I finally gave up hoping they would come back and cancelled.,0
"I ordered a subscription and 3 months later, I still have not received a copy yet.",0
ordered this for my 13 year old daughter. she loves getting magazines in the mail. it so cute to watch her look at them,4
Cant beat the subscription here!,4
I got a few good ideas out of this magazine.  I'll probably continue the subscription since it was a fair price.  I would recommend it.,3
I love everything about this magazine from the high quality paper to the brilliant images to the lovely text. Well worth the cost of S&H to the U.S.,4

I have and use Kindle on my iPad.
The Readers Digest as an App will not allow me to adjust my screen to my required settings.",0
I have always liked House Beautiful. I got it for a good price so was really happy with this purchase.,3

Has some good ideas.,3
Horrible magazine,0
I have been reading paper copy of this magazine  it's full of details and information I recommend this to any political reader,3

This product is not available for either Windows or Android so it is useless to me,0
This is like a mini catalog you'd get in the mail from a makeup company than a magazine. Filled with ads. Not happy I spent that kind of money on this junk.,0
"this magazine used to be really good with lots of info, how to's and boat reviews. it is getting thinner and thinner. i wouldn't buy it anymore if not for my husband.",2
Enjoy reading this but it is skewed towards men.,3

Another one of my absolute favorite magazines that I look forward to getting every month.,4

Not what I thought it was going to be; It's all salon advirtisements. I thought it was going to be hair styles.,1
Still waiting. Don't ask me for a review before I get my first issue. Check back in a couple months.,0
I love to read this time and time again.,4
I have lost all past issues that I have not read and apparently last week's which I have not finish.  Kindle app bites!,0
Love this magazine. Easily was able to update my subscription.,4

Thought it would help me in my finances but all topics were unrelated to me,0
My favorite magazine. Has been since I was a teen.,4
length of time for renewal to kick in seems quite long given today's technology.  price isn't as reasonable either since we are paying more than last year.,2

"Who would pay this amount for an electronic version ??
I am just dissapointed.",0

"l mostly flip through Elle these days as it doesn't really offer me much actually interesting substance. It's not bad, but it's annoyingly full of ads.",2
This product is pretty good except for you most likely will never receive your 12th issue. Other than that you get disks of demos every month and pretty good articles.,3

I am enjoying the articles about people and food in this magazine.  Can't beat it for the price.  Generally a great magazine.,3

THIS IS A GREAT INFORMATION SOURCE.  HAS SO MANY NEW IDEAS TO USE ON YOUR CAMPING TRIP.  JUST LOVE THE NEW MOTOR HOME REVIEWS,4

Mag didn't download completely.,0

This was the best book I have ever read. It's very inspiring and eye opening. I loved it so much.,4
Just a renewal of a magazine I've been following for 20+ years,3
Send old issues to count as part of the new subscription.  Not right,0
Best writing on the planet.,4

It is taking three months to get the first magazine of the subscription and now I missed out on the boats of 2015 issue.,0

Happy with price and product,3
Daily readings and the devotional given provide me with a great way to start the day and bring forth a new sense of focus every day.,4

I love it!  Just how I remember it from my younger years. Entertaining and informative and heartwarming stories. One of my favorites of all time!,4
The shipping says 802 months for shipping?!??!,0
Why does Women's Health seem like nothing more than an ad for the latest trendy product or device month after month?,1

I have read this many times and order a year and still have not gotten one copy!  It is now mis oct!!,0
ITS BEEN ALMOST A YEAR AND I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY FIRST ISSUE. NEVER CONTACTED ME. HORRIBEL COMPANY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.,4
Several years ago I was also receiving this magazine.  It is 1/4 the size it used to be with not many recipes inside.,1
"too many adds, not enough content",1

Not possible to read on Kindle or Android Kindle. Too small to see a magazine page. Forget zooming around...that takes away the fun. Please let me read it on my pc.,0
Too much to read in mmy time frame,0
Absolute garbage.,0
For a fashion magazine I prefer VOGUE hands down.,2
did not order this,0
Bad choice for me,0
only got like 4 issues and thats it never again not happy and i would of liked my money back,0

Bought for my daughter she got the first issue then two more then didn't get anymore not happy and she watches the mailbox everyday in hopes it will come.,0
It's just okay. Don't expect much when you order it through Amazon for cheap - pretty sure it's about half of their regular issue size.,1

I can't wait for this magazine to come every month - great articles!! Great for both a cyclist and a road racing fan.,4

A good guide to stay motivated to run,2
"The magazine didn't really have anything to read during that month.
I like the actual magazine then the kindle version.",2
There were way too many ads and not enough valuable content -- in fact many of the features were repetitive and seemed recycled. I'd prefer Bust magazine.,1

So tired of the same stuff in every issue...not worth the 5 bucks I spent!,0

Never found time to explore the magazine.  It's written for the more serious investor.,2
Terrible magazine now.  Nothing like years ago.  It was mostly advertisements.,0
Great deal! Mom loves it!,4
I liked it; just never had enough time to read it very consistently.,3
The volume I read basically mentioned only technology aspects which I didn't like. It's not of my interest. I thought it was more political.,0

"I never got the magazine in the mail.... And I would very much like to receive it, I ordered it over a month ago, so shouldn't it be here?",0
Makes me feel like less of a man to read this stupid magazine.  Advertisements and fluff articles.  Like Martha Stewart Living and the New Yorker for suburban men.  No thanks.,0
This is a favorite of mine and it arrived in perfect time for a trip I am taking. Will purchase again.,4
Best journal for pastel artists,4
I do not have the November or December issures. Still showing the October issue. What gives. Not the Vanity Fair I thought it would be.,0
"I love having access to the magazine on digital devices, so as not to carry around heavy issues.  But I also love to have the paper issue to keep in the guest room.",3

"This is my favorite magazine. Great ideas, beautifully presented, and reminding my how much I love France.",4
Not really worth it. There are other magazines with more information. Didn't have enough information to bother reading.  I don't really care about what celebrities are wearing.,0

I love reading this magazine but lately everyone I buy an issue on my kindle it won't load properly.,0

Don't like this TV guide. Very hard to follow,0

"I thought it was pretty good, enjoyed reading it.",3
"money

Never received printed version of magazine, no tote bag either. Electronic version wouldn't allow me to download with out paying again. Don't waste your money.",3
"I will not renew it. I subscribe to many other food/cooking magazines, so I definitely have others to compare it to. It does not have the kind of recipes I would make.",1
"Ordered this in May, it's almost September, still no magazine.  This appears to be a trend per the other comments, Amazon needs to step in.",0

Good  magazine,2
"Always loved SOUTHERN LIVING, even gave a subscription to my Daughter for years.....then the price went out of sight.....the offer I got on Amazon was well worth ordering again.",3
Really good articles and the best part is that they usually have coupons in them so it's like getting the magazine for free if you use the coupons.,3
When I pay for an HBO subscription I don't get tons of pointless ads so when I pay for a magazine subscription I expect the same.,0
Very lucid insightful and well writen,3
Waste of time. Mostly advertising,0

A little disappointed in the time it took for the first issue to be received but overall the magazine is satisfactory.,2

"I got a free copy of the November issue and it states the full one year subscription rate is $19.99, so I don't see how amazon can claim this as a discounted price.",2
The rest of the magazine leaves a lot to be desired.  Not too much interesting stuff.  It is poorly written and not interesting.,2

i wish there were zero stars. I only received one magazine since I paid for the subscription. Do not bother with this magazine. They have a lot of negative reviews for a reason!,0
This was purchased for my granddaughter.  She loves the magazine.  She has even entered several scholarship contests in the magazine. Would recommend to any young horse lover,4
"THERE WERE NOT MANY GOOD PICTURES , THE WRITING IS BORING",1
Nina Garcia is such a tough critic on Project Runway - thought this would be a better magazine.,1
"Great content, fun articles, but given a 4 for ease of navigation",3
Poor format and articles are not presented very interestingly.,1
No magazine with the public's best interests in mind would put idiots like Food Babe on the cover of their publication.,0
I prefer the actual magazine,0
"Great coverage of current events, I look forward to reading it weekly.",3
it is not easy to read have to kept going back from the beginning to where you left off every time you stop. printing too small,0
Not happy with the publication,1
"Love this magazine! I am a visual learner, so I look forward to learning  tricks and tips to common household projects. The new tool reviews have been spot on as well!",3
the price is great! one of my favorite mags,4
"The articles are all too short and it's not that informative, but the pictures are interesting...",1
"Love love this magazine!! Positive, wholesome, good stories as well as recipes and much more!",4
"Always useful for trip planning, but not a primary source.  Suggestions often far  too expensive for my middle class pocketbook.",1
Allure is one of my favorite magazines!,4
"There few articles.  The magazine is mostly ads and classifieds, which isn't what I was looking for.",2
There is hardly any content in this magazine and the formatting of what content is there makes it hard to read. Not recommended,0
not much inside,0
"I have a print subscription, and I'm excited to have this on my Kindle as well.",3
Not enough content. Don't want to let me stop subscription.  Would not buy it again!,0
"National and International News, old Classic Movies and Sports are mostly my interest, so I find TV Guide of limited value.",2
This is my favorite magazine. The order was timely and the price for auto renewal is terrific!! I will subscribe to more magazines through Amazon now,4
"My wife got this and I briefly thumbed through it. Not really thrilled, more orientated to the female audience. I can't speak for her, but she didn't renew her subscription.",0
"I'm officially too old for cosmo... although it's a great magazine, the bf stories and work stories just don't relate to my life... although - love the style ;)",2
