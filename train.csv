906,Good stuff on fitness and eating healthy. Too much crap about sex and how to either do it better or get more of it. Should just stick to fitness/well-being.,3

66445,Not what I was looking for.,5
66444,Not for me - didn't find anything new to cook -,3
911,I only received 3 (THREE) copies of my subscription. I fill ripped oft!,2

940,"Rubbish
Full of ads",1
943,Got it for my son but he had to cancel it because there were too many risqu&eacute; articles and pictures in it (he has 3 small boys),3
66480,I feel that there are too many ads and should be more articles and recipes. I do like the articles,4
945,Too many adds!,3
66481,I love this magazine. They share super recipes and make healthy eating a more upbeat and attractive plan! The cookbooks are awesome too!,5
946,"A great mix of general nutrition , lifestyle , and exercise articles .",4
66485,This is a very nice magazine. There is a lot of nice recipes that I would definitely give a try.,4
950,i don't like that its a running subscribtion,3
66488,Great magazine..Realistic recipes. I read cover to cover! Bookmarked and highlighted a ton of useful stuff!!!  Very happy and will continue my subscription.,5

66523,"Best magazine [in Spanish], ever!  I've given a couple of gift subscriptions; it's that great!",5
991,Did not find it worthwhile,1
66529,"I just received my first edition of the magazine. I am verypleased with it. It is written in Spanish but that is  my

66572,I've enjoyed my new subscription to Philosophy Now on Kindle - an ideal way to access this magazine for an Antipodean!,4
1037,This only came for two months and then just stopped... not a very good mag anyway,1
66578,Philosophy Now has accessible articles that anyone can enjoy from the lay person to more sophisticated reader of philosophical perspective.,4

1044,"I'm sure it's a pretty good mag, but I'll never know, because it will not download to either my Kindle or my PC.",3
1042,Not available  for purchase? Why list it under Kindle Unlimited  then?,1
1046,Not compatible on Android tablets via Kindle app.  Beware...,1

Thank you!",3
66615,This magazine is chock full of lovely photos but I didn't find much inspiration or focus. I prefer antique-shabby chic-cottage-style.,2
66625,Did not care for the stories and some of the paragraphs and punctuations were incorrect.  Just not my type of reading.,4
1091,Thought this magazine would be similar to Cosmo but unfortunately I was wrong. It seems kind of boring to me.,3

69706,Plenty of easy recipes,4
69707,"This is my favorite magazine, I love the wonderful recipes.",5
4182,I have had Texas Monthly for 3 years now. Almost every issue has multiple great stories. My only complaint is the amount of multiple page ads (travel guides) in it every week.,4

69730,"Actually, I'm not that into cooking, but a friend is and I purchased this for her.  She loves it.  Great gift idea for that chef in your family!",5

69766,Not impressed!,2
4235,"I cannot say enough about the Family Handyman issues. I love them, they are a great source of information. Awesome!",5

4240,"This is a great magazine that is filled with wonderful ideas, unfortunately the ideas are not affordable to the average household.",3

Sorry it, too, has gone the 'way of the wind'.",1
69796,"I have been subscribing to Taste of Home since the beginning, and I love it.  It is the first magazine I look at when it arrives.",5
69808,inability to enlarge text to us recipes with which to work,1
4289,Very difficult to understand and play.,2
4291,The magazine is chocked full of interesting places to visit and make lasting memories.  I am going to enjoy and make the most of my six issues of this magazine.,4
4294,"This magazine is great, the pictures, writing and even the adds are beautiful. I feel like I'm sharing part of the world I haven't yet traveled in.",5
69832,Do not like the new format.  Was a previous subscriber and like the format of the older magazines better.  Recipes have not been that great in the past couple of issues.,1
4298,"The stories, locations, and special interests topics are spectacular and well written.  Would recommend this to all of my friends.",4
69840,"I love these books, always have and so glad that i can find them on amazon. I love trying a lot of the recipes in these catalogs,",5
4309,Really enjoyed this magazine & especially all the great ideas.,4
4313,More Ads than magazine. A little disappointed.,3
69850,Use these recipes a lot. Love them all super easy and delicious. Has lots of ideas for freezing and easy prep,5
4316,Too many ads !,1

69864,Love the fact that my niece who is the receiver of this gift subscription loves this magazine. Thanks for the automatic renewal,5
4328,"The magazine has very little content in my opinion. In the end, its ok. I don't recommend it, but that's just me.",3
69866,"My mother used to cook from this magazine all the time.  The recipes now are too complicated, call for seldom used ingredients and just are not appealing to me.",2
4331,"I've taken the magazine in the past, but have not yet read a recent issue.  However, I've always enjoyed it previously.",4
4332,My dad called to let me know he got his first issue.  He and mom love it.  I knew that they would.  Thanks Amazon for making it available at a great cost.,5
69872,"A good combination of easy recipes, with nutritional information now added, to inspire you in the kitchen and help you keep the calories in check if are watching what you eat.",4
69882,I bought this as a gift subscription for my daughter-in-law.  She loves it!  I'd get a subscription for myself if they published a vegetarian version.,4
4349,we renew this every year- my husband loves it! I love it because I can inspire him to make and repair things for the house.,5
69896,"Best cooking magazine that exists! I subscribe to many cooking magazines, but Taste of Home far exceeds the others. Holiday issues are especially wonderful",5
69899,"WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE ISSUES PER YEAR, DO NOT FEEL THAT MY MONEY IS WELL SPENT. INTERESTING TO READ.",4
4367,i did not order auto renewal....and there was an additional discount offered which i was not given,1
4372,I was disappointed as I don't travel on quite the grand scale they cater to.  I cancelled after 5 mos. as I couln't find anything appliable to my style.,3
4377,I would like to see more information on great places that aren't only for the 1%.  We can afford great vacations but not at places starting at $500 a night.,3
4379,They are some interesting articles even though the magazine is very flat.,4
69922,"If you love to cook and try different recipes, this is the magazine for you. They have a variety of recipes too. We have tried many of them and they are great.",5
4391,"Good magazine, with lots of interesting info and trivia on various places in Texas, and the way of life there.",3
69931,"You get what you pay for ($5).  Several copies came about 3 months after I ordered.  Nothing since.  I have not went ""on-line"" to read whats on there.",3
69932,I bought this magazine for my husband who is a network administrator and he reads cover to cover. I have no tech background and I enjoy looking at some of the articles as well.,4
69940,Got it for one year for $5. Now it's kn auto renew for $25 and I can't figure out how to turn it off. May have to call them...,1
69941,"Handy to have both version,s but honestly one or the other would suffice. I haven't had a situation where I had one and used the same issue of the other.",4
69942,Not my kind of reading.,2
69945,"Bad experience. These magazines are almost like 85% adds and 15% real info. I wish I could cancel this. By the way, they enrolled me for another year. Just plain bad.",1
69948,Disappointed with the design of the magazine. I couldn't get into the content.,2
4413,More than half of the magazine is ads. So much I got bored of flipping thru the pages.,2
4415,got back to the 70s really ugly ideas,1
69954,I'm just not a fan of wired magazine.,1
69964,"A pain to load on tablet, and a pain to read on a tablet",3
69969,"I love the articles in Wired. They are relevant, interesting, and educational.",5

4440,Couldn't do without this magazine-- been reading for over 30 years!,5
69976,"Enjoy the magazine, but too complicated to download & read.  Sorry!",1
4443,I did not need a renewal and do not appreciate your doing so.,1
69981,"Problem is with the hard copy that is perfumed, causing allergic reaction.  I do not buy magazines with perfume inserts.",2
69984,IT IS A WEIRD MAGAZINE TO READ... IT IS NOT SET UP LIKE A NORMAL MAGAZINE WITH EASY TO FIND ARTICLES BUT MORE OF SHORT DITTIES ON A LARGER VARIETY OF SUBJECTS...,4
69985,"A self-absorbed, narcissistic rag!",1
69987,Good Product Great Price - What I was hoping for,4
69989,"Wired is a quality magazine with great production standards. However, its hard to say it is any better than keeping up with your news online.",2
4454,"The subscription  started a month earlier than I was told, which was great...",4
69991,"Used to be a great magazine, not so much anymore.",2
69992,The one magazine I read from cover to cover.,5
69993,"I love this magazine, always interesting articles, great photos and even the ads are interesting.",5
4456,good rag.,4
69998,"While Vanity Fair isn't what it used to be under Tina Brown, it's still worth a subscription. As far as guilty pleasures go, this is a harmless one.",4
69999,"who doesn't love Vanity Fair? I've been reading for 20 years, and probably will for another 20. Very much enjoy it.",4
70006,"Best mag, digitally and for real.  Dolan's guest editing was fantastic and matched the movie!",5
70010,Not impressed with Content,1
70012,I needed Vanity Fair for Kindle with the ability to enlarge text. Could not do that,1
70017,The publication was great as always I purchased in February of this year and was shocked that it auto-renewed in november.  Not happy about this!,1
4484,I think its a good magazine except there are too many ads in it. Lots of good projects in it though.,3
70025,Vanity Fair has interesting content if you can find it among the ads.  Amazon subscription services offer a nice discount--just hope it was not a teaser rate.,4
70027,Not happy with the publication,2
70029,Was meant to extend subscription - now getting double issues. Useless.,1
4496,"very big waste of money, wouldn't take it again even if it was free",1
70034,Enjoy reading this magazine.,4
70035,no-hope it is cancelled~it is printed on colored background and difficult to read,1
4502,I don't like it.  It focuses too much on what the stars are wearing and not enough stories.  I won't renew it.,2
4503,Short on stories.,3
4504,"No better than it was years ago when I quit subscribing.
Too many ads and not enough articles of interest.
Still pretty poor.",2
70045,"I loved Wired, and the price ended up higher than I thought. Just use the mail slips after your first one.",4
70046,The magazines contents could be a less yuppie-focused.,4
70058,"I have subscribed to Vanity Fair for many years, I have no complaints about the magazine. I just wish that i could increase the size of the font on my Samsung Galaxy  .",3
70063,"Too much advertisement and not enough hard technology and innovations.  I was impressed by some articles and information, but was overwhelmed by the commercialization.",2
70064,The articles have gotten very gimmicky with misleading headlines and pandering subject matters. It's a real shame wired sold out.,2
70065,"The amount of interesting articles declined. I'd like to see articles on car technology, automation, control, drones, robots, kids teaching technology tools, etc",1
4533,"Mostly ads anyway, this magazine is only for the wealthy.  I have better ways of spending my money than wasting $200 on a throw pillow.",1
4535,Still has too much advertising for the regular price of the magazine.  Not sure if I will renew or buy in future on regular basis.,4
70074,"The ratio of ads to content is disproportionate.  Although the ads are beautiful, I prefer the articles.  Maybe I am just envious of the beautiful models and gorgeous merchandise.",4
70076,I haven't received all the issues in the mail and I can't access the website on my kindle.  DO NOT buy this.,1
70080,The above  Didn't the above get your attention.  If not Vanity Fair is brain dead.  etc  etc  etc  etc etc,1
70082,I was completely unable to download it to my ipad so it was worthless to me --- I would really like to try it again if it would work.,1
4555,Most of the magazines were mainly filled with pictures and not many interesting articles to read.,3
4562,I could not take looking at this anymore than 10 minutes. It was full of articles and pictures of shallowness. Our country is in deep trouble if we listen to these airhead!!,1
70098,I love getting it on my kindle. I have it everywhere!  Makes it easy to access and share. Thanks again.,5
4564,One of my favorite magazines to pick up and read. Finally broke down and purchased it online thru Amazon. I received my first issue in about three (3) weeks.,5
70103,Love my Bon Appetit!!!,5
4571,I have still not received even the 1st copy. I ordered & paid for it several weeks ago.,1
70111,some months much better than others but overall ok,3
70112,"Love Bon Appetit, hate hate hate this app. It totally sucks. After a year I still couldn't even navigate from page to page. Ugh, terrible terrible app.",1
70118,"Many repetitive recipes.
Hard to get through the process of authentication once you subscribed it.",3
70120,"I loved La Cucina, but since it's no longer available in this country this magazine is okay.",3
4583,Way too many ads in this magazine and not enough travel content for the regular traveler.  I won't renew this subscription when it's time.,3

4601,"My husband loves this magazine!  It offers great tips on clubs, courses, and tournaments.  I catch him with this magazine at least once per day!",5
70139,I liked the old Allure style much better.  These models not so attractive to look at.  Allure's articles on beauty products always very good.,3
70140,Hi! Love this magazine.,5
4605,"Subscribed through Amazon for one year from July 2014 to July 2015. Got automatically renewed in April 2015 without notice, three months before it is supposed to renew.",1
4607,unusefull,1
4609,Popular Science remains one of my top magazines. It keeps me up with a lot of things happening in the tech world.,4
70148,Best Magazine I have ever paid for. Always the most interesting stuff in them and samples!,5
70152,The magazine is not delivered in Brazil - and this is not stated in the original information.,1
4617,"This magazine is full of great articles, tips and lots of information for a homeowner. I love to read it.",5
70157,"It's ok, but the magazine has 90% Publicity and VERY short articles to actually READ... :/",3
70159,"I liked that I received it, but on the first night of reading, I nearly finished it!",3
70160,My download wasn't in English. I can't even read it.,1
4625,"This is truly one of the best written, most interesting magazines available.  While its appeal is mainly to Texans or former Texans, others will find the articles interesting.",5
4627,"Amazon took their time getting the subscription going, but it is a good magazine.  A little more ""left"" than most Texan's views, but lots of good article none the less.",4
70163,can't figure out how to view digital version.  what a rip. :(,1
4632,"I've always loved this magazine---I'm so glad I finally got around to getting a subsrciption!

YES, there ARE moderates and liberals in Texas!",5
4633,"Four months after sale and still not the first issue. My subscription must be in limbo-land,",1
70169,Too many ads but ok,3
4636,a gossip magazine that is good only to kill time,2
70174,Just not my thing.  I cancelled the subscription.,3
4638,Good to read,2
4643,"Ordered a subscription on March 7th, as of April 9th, have only received one issue. Item is now listed as ""unavailable"". Rip off.",1
70180,"So far, they have only sent me one issue, which came LATE after the month had already passed. (I got the September issue in October. Really?)",1
70182,"Love love my magazine, I get so excited",5
4650,"Great magazine, always beautiful rooms with wonderful ideas, have been getting it for years and it's a treat when it arrives.",5
70189,Good deal!!!!!!,5
4659,This magazine is full of ideas. Great do it yourself pictures. Tips from the pros. A year round gift too.,5
70197,"When they say there is a version for a tablet, they mean it. Unlike Kindle for PC, it's tablet or nothing. Next time I'll take their word for it.",1
4662,"one thing about Handyman, if you have taken it for more than a year you see a lot of repeats.  differant artical and slightly differant plans, but in general it is all the same",3
4670,"They must be really desperate for ideas, or really want to push this product. Is this the best they could come up with.",1
70208,"The content IS advertising! The whole magazine is nothing but promotion of products, and they should pay ME to read it.",1
4684,Golf magazine has good tips & good analyses of equipment.,4
70220,It's a lifestyle magazine not fashion. I do not need to see two guys making out or a nude woman to learn fashion trends. No content just ads.,1
70223,"Haven't received a bOOk yet, and it seems like the 6 months is actually 4. Not happy about this subscription so far.",1

70236,"Love the magazine, but don't like the app and got frustrated trying to figure out where to go and how to get it in less than 100 clicks.",1
4702,Trashy magazine written by trashy people. Complete garbage.,1
4703,This was a pop up notice from the Kindle app on my phone.  Seriously?  Why would I want a gossip mag?,1
4706,NOT TARGETED FOR TEENAGERS,2
70248,I am 60 years old and this is not appropriate for me. It is more for a younger person. I would not be able to do any of the exercises .,3
70251,Wish it would say that it was not for kindle fire before I bought it and spent money on it,1
70253,"I liked the articles about exercises you can do at home.
I liked the interviews with the person on the cover.
I would recommend it to someone interested in exercising.",4
70260,I can not get the magazine on my kindle or Samsung tablet.  I am very VERY disappointed.  This is the only amazon purchase I have ever had a problem with. :(,1
4725,Love the ideas for decorating. They have great color photos and the latest styles for everything.  It's a great deal really.,5
70261,Love this magazine! Lots of great exercise and fitness tips. Even from celebreties. I have a hard time putting an issue down when I start flipping through the pages!,5
4728,We enjoy skimming the magazine to get decoration ideas for our house. Some of the ideas presented are interesting! If you are looking for ideas you might enjoy this magazine.,3
70264,I have been waiting way too long for the delivery of my first paper copy. and the electronic version is difficult to find/ access on a PC.,1
70267,Too much adverising. Backwoods Home magazine is way better.,1
70268,Wish it was published more then 4 times a year. This is my favorite magazine and always look foward to reading,5
70273,Boring magazine...all advertisments,2
4739,Still having technical difficulties processing my subscription?  It's been 6 months!,1
4740,What can you say about the perfect golf magazine?  My husband loves it.  Perfect gift for him!,5
4743,I purchased it for my husband for Father's Day and he loves it!,5
70281,i don't know how to use the one for oneline yet and i like the one that comes in the mail,3
4749,No problem with the product.,3
70285,Wonderful platform for up-and-comers; wonderful resource for enthusiasts.,5
4754,Horrible. None of the stories are real. Another tabloid rag mag. Won't be renewing. Good thing I only paid 5 bucks.... That's all it's worth for a year.,1
70290,Found it boring and opted out before I ponied up my nickel.,1
4755,Crap on toast,1
4765,I like the magazine and have read it for several years.  Get a lot of good ideas but it often leads me to the big box home improvement stores where I spend money I don't have.,3
4776,I love the pictures and ideas in this magazine.  I've received it for several years now and just love every one.  It speaks to all types of styles and house sizes.,5
4781,"Especially House Beautiful, and I really appreciate that I don't have to download any other apps just to read an issue.",4
4784,"It's great!!!
I would recommend this book to all of my friends. I have learned a lot from this magazine. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!",5
4788,The only thing I don't like about this mag is the fact that you are always flipping to the back to read the rest of the article. Great travel ideas.,4
4804,I have been subscribing to handyman for many years and I keep up with my old issues for my use as well as those that come by to borrow them.  Great ideas that we all can use.,5
70355,"not available for latam. When will that be fixed? it's absurd that in this digital era and selling Kindle devices across the world, content is restricted",1
4822,There was nothing classy about the homes or anything else..This wasn't the old House Beautiful that I remember..Another $15.00 ill spent.,1
4823,"This is perhaps my favorite magazine of this type. Interesting, beautiful homes in each issue with inspiring photos to boot!",5
70364,"I would really love to have this feature for my kindle. Unfortunately, it is not possible to download day one if you are a german customer. Will this be changed any time soon?",1
4835,Totally liberal and one-sided. I can't stand how biased this magazine is. Awful.,1
4837,It met my expectations,4
70377,Spent to much time talking about how they changed themselves and how great the magazine is..... Reality really not that good. Cancelled subscription after 1st issue.,1
4841,I like the magazine but reading it electronically is not for me.,2
4844,"To many ads and not enough real articlies to shank up my attention.
Truely, a loss of one my all time farvoite magazines!!!!",2
70389,"Tech articles are decent, but how many clown bikes with silly 30"" front wheels can one look at.  Who actually thinks that fad looks cool?",2
70394,wish there was more tattoos to get ideas from,3
4862,Got three magazines then charged for a renewal of 15.00 so ends up costing 5 dollars a copy and is mostly advertisements. Very Dissapointed,1
70399,So little of this magazine is actually dedicated to tattoos.  Some of the models are attractive but only have a few scratchy tattoos.,3
4865,"It's a nice magazine but not enough in them these days to warrant a renewal.  If cheap enough, it is worthwhile.",4
4867,I was hoping to find more ideas to use in my own home and suggestions for where to find inexpensive items.,3
4869,I was hoping there would be inspiring photos however most photos are so staged that it is not practical in real everyday life design.,1
70406,My mom just received her first issue. A Christmas issue in January. That shouldn't count as an issue in my opinion of its old. Just my two cents.,4
4873,"I bought the kindle subscription version, it sucks because of the extremely slow download speed. I will cancel it.",1
70412,Lovely magazine.  Great ideas and very good recipes.,4
70413,Hard to find the content I hoped for in the forest of ads...,2
70415,"Love everything about this magazine. Beautiful photos, great design inspiration, lovely recipes.",5
70419,More ads than I expected. Some good recipes,3
4892,Great magazine.  Provides a lot of great tips and tricks and reviews of tools and power tools. and lawn care power tools,4
70431,The content of this magazine is much too frivolous for my lifestyle. Will not be renewing.,2
70433,Love reading and getting new ideas. Always room for improvement that's why I didn't give 5 stars,4
70442,My Mom and I are avid fans! Couldn't go a month without reading this great magazine! WooHoo! From 2 Fans!,5
70443,"Wasn't what I wanted. Wanted the Spring in the South edition. Didn't get a chance to view.
Will have to see if this is worth the money.",1
70446,"I was so excited to see my favorite magazine in digital form until I saw it is not available for iPad. Oh well, hopefully soon.",2
4910,Always late,2
4918,This is a typical magazine for houses that are perpetually clean and with perfect decorating.  I can't relate to that at all.,3
70465,Too many ads in the magazine.,2
70467,Best magazine ever!!!!,1
70468,Love this mag!  I can actually understand the direction and the recipes always turn out great! Highly recommend!,5
4933,"I've been reading this magazine since 1970! It's just as good electronically as on paper so far, so no complaiaints. It's still the best overall guitar magazine that I know of.",5
4936,I find that this magazine is too full of advertising and not enough of the guitar lessons material I was looking for.  I won't re-subscribe.,2
4938,"I'm not sure that this is a very good magazine for me... Time will tell, but so far, I wish I subscribed to a different mag.",3
70481,"It's the basic southern recipes for the holidays-nothing spectacular.  Actually, it's not very memorable.  I had forgotten I had it on my Kindle.",3
4949,I've been receiving Family Handyman for a number of years and love it. I bought this copy for a friend.,5
4959,"These magazines are packed with lots of ideas for decorating a room, a house, a yard,  but half of the magazine has too many advertisements.",3
70495,Not as good as I hoped it would be. I'm more of a technical person so only one issue so far has kept my interest. The WIRED email articles I get are usually more interesting.,3

5010,I have been a subscriber for years. Love this magazine. Detailed projects. Good variety of articles. I always get something out of every issue.,5
5011,It is not what I expected.  I defintely do not want to renew for another year.  There are a lot of magazines that give you tips and ideas for your home.  Do not renew.,2

70924,I got the magazine when I thought it would never get here. I got the free scarf but never got the other two booklets. Not really that impressed.,1
70928,This magazine is mostly adds and ugly fashion choices that the average woman cannot afford anyway.,1

5414,Credit card charged over two months ago and no magazine yet. How about a refund?,1

71114,Would be great except I didn't receive my Sept issue or any free clutch.,1
5580,Perhaps regular readers of this magazine aren't bothered by the ads but I found that this magazine contained more advertisements than actual reading material and projects.,2
71117,I never received the free clutch. The magazine is  mostly ads; had to search for articles. The digital edition takes up too much data and doesn't maneuver easily.,1

71462,I ordered a subscription for my dad.  My dad told me that it was just a magazine full of ads and sports articles.  Apparently popular mechanics means ads and sports.,1

6707,Best magazine hands down.,5
6711,"The magazine is 90% ads, oh and even the articles are ads in disguise... Don't waste your money.",1

72298,"I was never able to access the magazine electronically, but did (and do) receive my print edition.",3

6943,The magazine has interesting articles as long as you overlook the obvious liberal bias and BS.,4
72482,"My granddaughter is thrilled, this is her favorite magazine!",5
6947,Why pay for a book of ads? There was like 4 stories and 30 pages of ads.,1

16381,Good informative magazine.,4

81965,Love the Magazine. Lots of hunting and fresh water fishing discussion. Even tells me what time of the day to hunt/fish.,5

81974,I ordered this magazine and only received a few copies.,2
16446,Bought for a present but my daughter in law does not want it any more.  I looked through it and thought it was good.,3

82058,Grandchildren enjoyed these with their parents,4
82066,"Good reading, informative.",4

I have always loved Analog. Excellent sci-fi, editorials, and I keep up with cutting edge science this way.",5
82140,Sensationist journalism without a lot of fact checking. it's not left wing at all nor it is right wing. It's just full of bogus info.,2
82144,too paritisan. I don't need someone to persuade me. I can make up my own mind. I want both sides of an issue. I will give it another couple of weeks.,1

17315,Not a great situation with the Kindle,3

84168,"Wrong magazine was delivered to my fire.  Tried to re do, same thing happened. Down loaded ""Candian Living""  so not a bad review against Style at home Magazine ...",1
18632,"Same content as the actual magazine so unless you are travelling and don't want to take the 'zine, fail to see what benefit there is to it, plus it takes an eternity to download.",1
84170,Love this magazine! Fresh and fun!,5
18634,"If I could, I would give this 0 stars. I have yet to be able to download the magazine.  Next time I will just buy a paper copy.",1
18642,I didn't much like this magazine at all.  It is very thin and there's not anything very interesting inside.  I would not buy this again.,1
84190,Good more info than most,4
18657,Got the first. Then it stopped been delivered!,3

18680,Another great travel related magazine,4
18682,Overrated Rag Publication..... There are much better choices out there to read..,1
84219,Several subjects covered to inspire and guide you. Found to be interesting and realistic in the spiritual arena. Worth reading.,4
84228,Not enough information,2
18697,"Love having this on my Kindle, no wrinkled pages. :) And I can take it with me wherever I go.",5
18707,Maxim has gone downhill over the years.  More of a yuppie mag now than appealing to the average Joe.,3

18752,The new format sucks then I try ed to cancel before the auto renewal date but guess what they still took money out . Terrible,1
18755,The magazine is geared for the 20 and 30 year old.  The pictures are sexy but not particularly outstanding and the articles are shallow.,3

18820,"Great gift for my husband, Arrived earlier than expected.",5

18869,Not my kind of travel. Too spendy.,3

34385,I don't think that the magazine suits the Kindle layout. There is also alot of ads which make the process of reading it harder.,3
34388,Best quilting mag anywhere,5
34390,"Changes format, fewer pages and all quilts are made with big chunks of fabric.",1
34404,Enjoy it every month,4
34406,Not quite the magazine it used to be but still very informative,4

34416,I'm not a quilter but my daughter loves it and asks to have it renewed each year. A nice gift that gives all year.,4
34418,"very well written, very insightful and informative",4
34423,"For a magazine that is supposed to be cutting edge, it has one of the worst Kindle experiences out there.  I may as well be reading a PDF.",1

it requires you to go through multiple copies
to find articles of value in applying
& appreciating the technology
it reports on.",3

38469,The liberal slant of this rag is obvious. I wouldn't read it in the doctor's office.,1
38480,"a blatant disregard for the values this country was founded upon, ptheuw.",1
38483,"This was to extend my existing subscription.....instead you have made me a new one which duplicates
mine,  Can you remedy this?  I do not need two magazines!",1
38488,Only 60% of content successfully downloaded to my Kindle Fire hd tablet! This is not acceptable for a e-subscription!,2
38507,Typeface so small can't read many articles.,3
38521,Not enough real news - too much fluff.,2
38524,Cannot change the font size. Option icon not working,1
38530,"The best I can say for the Digest is ""It's fair, not great or terrible, just fair.""  I won't be renewing my subscription.",1
38532,Excellent Magazine for summary information and humor. I have been receiving this magazine for over forty years. I highly recommend it.,5
38536,Best reading for adventure drama humor educational and for mysteries and stimulating the mind and at a great price. Thank you amazon,5
38548,I would not download this liberal rag app to my Kindle. Every article is about same-sex marriage or transgender lifestyle - no thanks!,1
38555,"Plenty of art work but effort should be spent on real ""news' not entertainment. Much better than issue about top 100",4
38556,This is difficult to use.  Have no idea how to get back issues  Not worth tinkering with.  It should work out of the box.,1
38557,"just getting use to using the kindle and how to approach reading this mag.  great mag, this type of lengthy response is ridiculous",2
38581,I havent' got it yet.  I'd like to know when I will start enjoying it. I hope it gets here in the following days.,1
38583,This is a nice little read that gives you insight into lots of different things.  With a toddler I don't have much time to read so this helps me keep up.,4
38587,Wow! Thankfully I read all the reviews here! I was tempted to suscribe for the low price of $5 per year but even at that I don't see a point doing it so.,1
38589,Keep track in your checkbook and write down when you first get your first reader's digest.  You won't get a full year.,1
38591,Could not access old issues online. Please E-Mail how I can access the old issues online with a Kindle Fire HD 8.9,4
38611,Years ago I used to read Readers Digest and its no where as good as it used to be. I have been giving it away to a friend.,3
38638,The Amazon price was the best I could find for 2 years of readersdigest. The first issue has already been delivered & we are totally happy. Thanks Amazon.,5
38662,I was happy with this app until they made recent changes.  I also lost access to all issues in library that I paid for.  NICE!!!!!,1
38663,This update did not fix the issue of being able to enlarge font/text size.  The app is useless except the videos built in the article,1
38669,TIME MAG is great ... but ... I'd prefer a PDF version instead of this interactive one. Or have the choice.,1
38677,It is great magazine with reliable articles that are of interest to all ages.  Great as a gift to a parent or grandparent.,4
38711,My husband and I decided we are too old for this magazine.  Many articles we know nothing about and don't care to learn.,3
38734,I subscribed to Time because Newsweek went all digital. This is a good buy for those who still like to read...on paper.,4
38735,"Time has been a part of our family for 40 years and will continue to do so.
I like the format and dependable world news coverage.",4
38736,"We love the digital access on my ipad mini. My wife likes the print edition, and I read it on my iPad mini on the go. A perfect subscription.",5

38773,"The service is terrible Once they have your credit card you are hooked
Beware they will continue to reorder even if you cancel.",1
38786,Time magazine is so great! They always have well written articles that I enjoy very much. I subscribed just to use it on my iPad 2 and I donate the physical copies to my salon.,5
38796,"Bought this as a gift for someone. The price was reasonable, though I  have seen it for less on Amazon.  Still, nice magazine.",3
38806,"Time magazine, of course is great (on most topics) however Amazon's price beat dircet price offered by Time magazine.",5
38808,".. I discovered the Economist and understood what a real in depth weekly news magazine could be.  Sadly, Time does not really fit the bill anymore for me.",3
38823,I got this as a gift for my dad and he loved it! Thanks so much! :),5
38853,I will always purchase my magazine suscriptions from Amazon!  They are the best deal you can get anywhere!,5

The process was simple and the one-year subscription was used to extend my current one.

Thanks.",5
38880,"Fewer pages, less substance, little real news, some entertainment news.  Just not worth it.",1

39267,"I love Elle for the fashion, reviews, articles, but it seems that there is more advertisements than the magazine itself.",3
39270,What can you say this magazine is great and never fails to have some great articles inside. Love the fashion articles the most.,5

41122,The magazine has turned into worthless garbage. It automatically renewed and when I discovered that fact I tried to cancel to no avail.,5
41140,I have been subscibing for over 30 years now and Amazon offers the absolutely best rates.  Extending an exiting subscription couldn't be easier or more reasonable.,5

41777,A magazine that features food babe is a magazine that shouldn't exist.,1
41780,This mag doesn't do its research.  Just saying something doesn't mean it is right.  Its that simple.,1
41781,"The very fact that you've featured the crackpot known as ""food babe"" on one of your covers means that you are untrustworthy as a source of health information.",1
41783,I guess they ran out of credible sources things to write about so no need to buy it now.  Seriously - The Food Babe???????  Who is the editor for this ragazine,1

41789,This magazine surrendered its last vestiges of credibility when choosing to peddle snake oil and promote the charlatan Food Babe.  Shameful.,1
41792,It's insulting to bank of the ignorance of the public by passing off pseudoscience as actual information.,1
41794,A magazine which propagates half-truths and full lies is not what our world needs.,1
41795,"I'd rather not read a magazine that features a fearmonger and self-appointed ""food investigator"" on its cover.

Enough said: [...]",1

41809,"Sadly they've turned against their readers, and worst of all, with psuedoscience.",1
41812,"Putting a well know uneducated fear monger (Food Babe) on the cover and then claiming that everyone that was vocally opposed to it must have been paid to do so, yeah I think not.",1

41889,Psuedoscientific BS dressed up as a health magazine.,1
41891,"You had a highlight/Cover piece on food babe.
With that said how can anyone take what's in your mag seriously.",1

42006,I look forward to every issue of this magazine. It has great information and beautiful illustrations. Getting copies in both paper form and on line is especially useful to me.,5
42007,Probably won't renew.  Too much $$ for too little helpful info.  Lots of ads.  And one or 2 artists high-lighted.  HOLLEY,3
42013,"Reupped my subscription. Really enjoy this magazine, and love the kindle version that comes with the subscription. A must for the watercolor artist.",5
42014,I liked being able to leaf through the magazine to see the techniques used by artists and even to gain some ideas.,4

43243,Great News Paper.,5
43248,Live out in western NY where its hard to find a paper carrying national news so this fit the bill nicely. Also love doing the crossword puzzle!,5
43251,The papers were delivered 2 dos after publication.  Best to go directly through the publisher and get it delivered same day.,1

43322,A little much for me - technical sort of.  I'm more or less a beginner in this.  At least  I gave it a chance.,3
43323,"this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time.  if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator, readsomething else.",5
43325,"I never received this order. I received an email stating they were cancelling it and I will receive a refund for the gift certificate, but never received it",1

43517,Cancelled my subscription before the 30 day free trial ended. This magazine did not hold my interest. Also found it a little difficult to read on my Fire.,2
43518,cheaper version of cooks illustrated magazine and has more down to earth meals with ingredients that I have in my kitchen,4
43527,"This magazine does not contain simple country recipes that I would cook.  It is too ""uptown"".  I have asked this magazine to cancel my subscription but so far have had no success.",1

43554,AS AN RC PLANE FANATIC THIS MAG IS THE BEST OUT THERE. IT'S WORTH EVERY CENT!,5
43555,"i hate this magazine.  it always comes late, if at all.  i don't have any problems with the other magazines i subscribe to.  buyer beware!",1
43562,I am disappointed that the magazine comes so late by mail - almost one week from the time you can buy it in the supermarket.,3
43572,Auto renewal is a hidden charge! Would not purchase this product again!,1
43579,"This is how I received my first magazine. It is torn apart, and someone tried to paste it, but couldn't have done a worse job. And I can't find the way to complain about this",1
43580,Pain in the ass to read this on a Kindle - and if signed for 30 day free trial. Good Luck finding a link to actually cancel it.,1
43581,This is an opinion magazine full of largely unreferenced wordy statements and conclusions.,2
43602,A once-great journal has joined the vapid heard & now sells the same shallow narrative as all the rest. May it Rest In Peace.,1
43603,"Easy to navigate, I enjoy way you can see the entire page but choose to zoom in on a specific article and then scroll to the next.",3
43604,Their app has been multiple charging our accounts. And then it is difficult to get a refund. Must fix it this century - right?,1

43648,The best magazine there is. Period.,5
43662,A great read every week.  Never disappointed.,5
43664,Good but too rich for my blood.,2
43670,The navigation features are archaic. You should be able to view the different sections and their content more easily.  The android app is much better in that regard.,3
43671,Access .  Please cancel.,1
43681,Don't like the format.  Love the pub though.,3
43686,It will be good if we are able to download audio edition,4

43697,Disappointed that the online subscription was not included,4
43699,The best in-depth business mag.,5
43705,Does not come with digital access. The economist sells the Print + Digital subscription for less on their website. Deeply disappointed,1
43714,One of the best magazine for world news.,5
43718,Ridiculous that paying for the online edition doesn't get you access to the Kindle version as well,1
43721,"Good topics and analysis, but price of kindle can be lower than printed version for one issues and also subscriptions..",4
43729,Nowhere does it say whether the $9.99 price is for an annual or monthly subscription !!How deceptive is that ??,1
43750,Magazine miss top notch. Problem is two copies are coming on this renewal.,3
43751,this price is too high.  the paper magazine gives same content for less. kindle jacks up the price. what a scam!,1
43766,Best news magazine out there.,5
43767,I love this periodical,5
43779,Simply the best!,5
43791,"Unfortunately, did not see that this offer does not include both paper and digital.",4
43798,Very disappointed. The Kindle version was very abbreviated and definitely not worth the price.,1
43802,Too liberal sometimes,3
43807,"The Economist. I like it but it is a trifle expensive for my pocketbook.  To buy it now and then is okay, but not a subscription to the magazine.",3
43809,Awesome unbiased news source. Great once around the world for international politics.,5
43832,"It's simple, Not the same as news stand but same price you should have it lesser priced to compensate the fact that your not getting the same product",3
43847,"The magazine has an obvious bias and agenda on many issues, and that becomes tiresome when one is simply looking for news.",1
43854,"is always a learning experience reading this magazine, i like not to read opinion, i lie to read information to reach my own conclusion",4
43896,"I bought it on August, but it still not send to me. Can you send me soon and I have homework about it!",3
43916,This mag is in the good category .It is worth the 10dollar fee. It helps me keep up with the latest on economics,4
43934,"You get much more value out of an online subscription, I absolutely love the content, but currently the Kindle version is WAY overpriced for what you get.",1
43960,This review is regarding the Economist on Kindle. Great magazine and format but the price on Kindle is too much to stomach.,1
43967,You are better-off getting print and on-line subscription and then access it in your Kindle. The kindle economist is quite skinny.,1
43986,Great magazine but getting less for a higher price is not worth it.  Do not subscribe to the kindle edition!,1
44006,"too expensive, especially if taking into concideration the print student subscription... sorry amazon, but ill rather read the economist in print, for approx 30% lower price...",1
44008,the packaging of the mag is broad and the price is high. i typically read two articles per issue. pls think about four dollars per mo,1
44015,In Canada we buy the US edition of the Economist at the newstands. Why on earth is it not available on Kindle?,1
44029,"What a failure in marketing and price setting.
Enough has been in said in the other comments.
Whomever made the decision to price at this level should find another line of work.",1
44047,Through academic subscription I can get the print copy delivered for $75. This quoted price for an electronic version is outrageous.,1
44065,Why does it take a week to make the Kindle version available.  i find it very convenient to read and search but do not want to be a week behind in reading.,3
44073,"I agree with most of the other posts. This was one of the things I was most excited to get when I got my Kindle, but when I saw how much it cost I passed. Way too expensive!",1
44085,The Kindle subscription price for this publication is absurd ($35 annually more expensive than the print version),1
44091,I love the Economist in that it is so informative and relevant but this Kindle edition is way overpriced.,1
44096,"Too expensive.  I just retired and I can not afford it any more.
V.S., Congers, NY",2
44099,the kindle user won't bother with the paper version so it is not an issue that if you offer lower price on kindle the sales will drop. exactly the opposite.,1
44104,But the price is nuts! At least with the print version I can clip articles pass it along and take to my library when I am done.,1
44110,"This price is not just ridiculous it's offensive...  It's ""The Economist"", shouldn't they understand price points a little better than this?!?!",1
44171,"Well, perhaps the The Economist audience was the wrong population of reader upon which to attempt extortion?",1
44181,The Economist magazine needs to hire a good economist who can advice them on how to set a proper price for the Kindle version of the magazine.,1
44198,"who's seriosly going to pay more to get less.  Love the magazine, but I think you've lost your way on this one.  Very disappointed.",1
44204,"The Economist's content is and always has been great.  But an electronic edition that costs the same as the print is pure robbery.  Once it drops in price, I will subscribe.",1
44217,"It's a shame that the Economist, and probably to a lesser degree Amazon, are trying to gouge their customers after they've spent so much time and energy building goodwill.",1
44222,Much like my fellow readers I must express my disdain for the excessive pricing of this digital offering.,2
44230,I love the Economist and am all for saving a few trees and getting the kindle version but the price needs to be lower than at the news stands - period.,1
44245,"Who would pay this amount for an electronic version ??
I am just dissapointed.",1
44246,Much too expensive. If the price does not come down during the two week trial Iwill just cancel.,1
44254,"I was looking forward to the Kindle version of the Economist, but this is too expensive for an electronic version.",1
44264,"I've wanted this magazine for 6 months, and finally splurged and got it.

I love reading this magazine each week!  Puts all other news magazines to SHAME!",5
44320,Edited to look good on paper.  Probably edited by P.R. personal.  After the last nine years I don't see this as her words.,1
44331,Not interesting. Too many subjects that are irrelevant.,2
44334,Excellent price for subscription. Recipient was pleased.,5
44339,I didn't really like the magazine that much.  I found it full of advertisements.,3
44341,A little out of touch with main stream America.,3
44349,DIDNT LIKE,3
44350,It's changed...not what it once was.,4
44357,Love It! Love her! So grateful to have this magazine in my life. It's a gem!!!,5

44375,Love Oprah!!!!,5
44378,Great magazine.  My company also enjoys the articles.,5
44383,Not my fav,3
44385,Best price ever.,5
44394,I love the magazine but even with enlargement feature the layout of some copy makes stories hard to read.,3
44395,Terrible - who needs to listen to a  narcissist ?,1
44403,"I love O, The Oprah Magazine.  Subscriber to hard copy for years. Trying the kindle version is a treat,",5
44410,Thank You so much Amazon!! The Oprah Magazine continues to inspire and delight me daily!!,5
44414,I am tired of her political one sided garbage...it used to be a nice magazine but now not so much..,1
44420,"Even though I enjoyed reading some of the stories, the article on letting go had no relevance on what was advertised in the cover page.",3
44426,"Oprah, what can I say.  Nothing is as laughable as someone who believes they are way smarter than they are.  Lots of advertising, very little usable content.",1
44441,Oprah was a $5.00 magazine for one year so it was hard to pass up. Perhaps a 3.5 to 4 stars may have been better. But quite frankly I purchased it for the great price.,3
44444,Great magazine. Very inspiring.,5
44446,Always great ......,5
44449,"I WAS SURPRISED, TO MUCH ADVERTISING, VERY LITTLE CONTENT FOR AN OPRAH MAG.......LOVE OPRAH STILL,BUT NOT MAGAZINE....",3
44458,Scam...Shame of Oprah trying to take advantage of people that actually think she cares about any of them.,1

44465,You could not pay me to buy this horrible magazine again.,1
44472,I absolutely adore Oprah...I always love to read her What She knows for Sure on the last page of her magazine.,5
44478,"thank you. I work for weight watchers, so I love reading her magazine",5
44481,"I have always enjoyed this magazine, but feel like recently there are more ads than newsworthy articles!",4
44483,don't feel like supporting a racist woman who thinks all white males need to die off....,1
44484,I currently have an Oprah magazine subscription but I'm unable to get the free Kindle edition.,1
44489,I love everything about this magazine. Best birthday present ever.,5
44490,"I like it. Some of the stories are interesting, and the recipes.",4
44492,I have enjoyed this magazine for years. I renew every year for 17 years now.,5
44501,Will not buy.  Too many adds.  To elites.  Down home girl here.,1
44502,Don't like,1
44503,Bias and anti white,1
44504,Why would I want to read something from the most popular bigot on the earth?,1
44516,Love the magazine but wish I could receive it promptly every month.,1
44518,It just seems like a lot of ads and not much else.  It seems I liked it better when I read it years ago.,2
44524,This magazine consists more of ads than articles. Greatly disappointed.,1
44526,"I have only gotten the one issue, but so far so good.",4
44527,They make it VERY HARD TO CANCLE my subscription!  I was on the computer about an hour before I could get a phone  number!!,1
44539,Never managed to download the magazine,1

44547,It was informative,4
44553,Do not care for the writing of the articles. Very predictable and boring.,2

44590,"I have not been able to read the magazine, because it states, ""Your magazine download is in progress.""",1
44591,I like it so far.,4
44594,Dumb and so self serving.,1
44606,Will not resubscribe..,2
44607,Best book ever!,5
44609,Wasn't all that great to me. Filled with what seemed tons of ads more than something to keep my attention,2
44612,Just an Oprah advertising format. Not worth opening.,1
44618,"It is impossible to cancel subscription, even for the deceased.",1
44628,I've renewed this magazine for my mom and she LOVES it!,5

44680,"Love the magazine, but I thought this was a subscription yet I only receive one magazine.",4
44686,crappy mag,2
44688,Tablet screens are too small for magazine reading. Please make available for kindle pc.,1
44690,This is actually a gift for my mother. I've never read an issue. She seems to like it though.,4
44697,I do not want to receive this magazine!,1
44700,"Although the magazine received lots of coverage and advertisement, I don't think it lived up to all its pomp and circumstance. I lost interest in its content pretty quickly.",3
44701,Was the best magazine ever,1
44702,I did not want auto-renewal so I cancelled it.,1
44705,"Felt like it was mostly ads, sadly.",3
44708,"I love Oprah, but the magazie seems to be mostly advertisements.  It's not as good as I was hoping",1
44710,This is a good magazine with lots of helpful information.,4
44717,The magazine's quality has declined in the last two years. Much of it is repetitive and predictable. No longer relevant.,3
44722,"My wife loves this magazine, and I was able to get an amazing deal for a two year subscription.  It was less than a three issues at the new stand price",5
44725,"DID not order this item ,please remove from my account. I do not want this or any other magazine from you.",4

Have liked most monthly issues! Good price
at 10.00 dollars per year!",4
44735,I like the content and is very easy to navigate through the electronic version.  I would recommend rides to anyone.,4
44741,"Good articles - I enjoyed the articles on minimalism.  I think there are too many advertisements, in relation to the number of pages.",4
44758,"This magazine is always good.  Good articles, recipes, featured items, Dr Phil, Suzy Orman, overall worthwhile to read each issue.",4
44761,"Though I love the content, its a lot of ads to filter through just to get to the content. Love the way kindle handles the pages!",3
44762,"otherwise I wouldhave not ordered it, it is pretty much ads ads ads and not much else - what are you gonna do lol",1
44779,This magazine is awesome. I love that it hits so many topics that effects women of all ages. Thanks for the variety,5
44788,I love the articles and products reviewed in this magazine. The fashions are super and subjects for articles are always great.,5
44792,"At first liked her magazine, but find each issue is always the same with the same commentators and same style. Will not renew.",2
44803,"this is fifty pages of advertising. really, why would you pay for that. not for me. it's really really not.",1
44810,There wasn't anything interesting to read in this magazine compared to other magazines.  I would not order another one this was my second try in reading this,1
44814,Thought provoking articles mixed with fashion and beauty. It's the BEST! Who doesn't love Oprah? What are you waiting for subscribe!,5
44820,This is a wonderful magazine.  Purchasing from Amazon was the best!  I highly recommend it!  The articles are interesting and well written.,5
44827,"I really didn't want a renewal and tried to stop it but must have selected the wrong option...it's okay that I have it now, just don't always have the time to keep up with it.",3
44838,I never authorized this subscription to be automatically renewed.  Oprah magazine STOLE the price of the renewal from me.  This is a very dishonest business practice.,1
44856,"Now I know why I paid $5 for the subscription. There are more ads in it than stories. I love real life stories, not look at things I can't buy.",3
44861,Ordered in December.  I have yet to get a magazine.  I think I made a big mistake.  No answer as to why I have no magazine.,1
44863,So far not very satisfied!  I am still waiting for my first issue to arrive.  Paid for it on 12/6/12 - almost 2 months ago.,1
44865,i CANNOT TELL YOU HOW THIS MAGAZINE IS AS ALL i GOT WAS A LETTER THAT THEY WERE BACKED UP ON ORDERS AND WOULD RECIEVE IT LATER. THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.  WHAT HAPPENED.,1
44870,"It's Oprah! Besides it's always filled with lots of tips, food, clothing, jewerly, places to go and of course books!",5
44872,I have been a devoted Oprah Magazine subscriber for years.  I was very dissappointed to learn that I have to pay for the print and digital copy.,1
44877,"I usually enjoy this magazine, which is why I renewed, but the renewal process is not seamless, and I have not started getting the 2013 issues yet.",1
44884,I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would and I don't miss receiving it at this point.,3
44891,I renewed this magazine for a great price - couldn't ask for a better deal.  I have been getting this for years!,5
44893,Too much advertisement.  The articles are good however would like more articles and less advertsing. Received two issues not a year's worth.,3
44902,It's not that $18 is expensive its just that out of a 12 issues 4 maybe really awesome and the rest are so bad you can't believe it's O magazine.,3
44905,So far every issue of O Magazine has been filled with alot of interesting articles and great advice.  I look forward to receiving it every month.,5
44910,It was alright. If you like Oprah. The magazine just reminded me why I don't watch her shows. Maybe I'm too young to get it. I just didn't find it relevant to me.,2
44922,First magazine I downloaded and I found The Oprah Magazine easy to navigate. Only problem is that the June edition was so-so. Maybe July edition will be better?,3
44959,I still haven't recieved my first copy of this magazine and it was purchased at the beginning of March and it is almost May now.,1
44990,"Never got one issue- tried to cancel my order and it has been 5 months- nobody writes back
They take your money and never send!",5
44991,It's an ok magazine.  It was a good price when I purchased it.  It does take a long time for the 1st magazine to arrive.,3
44995,"I ordered a gift subscription at the Amazon $5 rate, and 8 months later, not a single issue has been sent, and not one reply to any email requests for explanations or refunds.",1
45003,I have not even received the ordered item and it was ordered over a month ago.  Kinda tough to rate or get excited about it.,1
45008,This magazine has lot of good stories and tips. Easy layout to the magazine as well.,4
45010,"I, also, ordered this magazine from Amazon for one year but have not received any issues.  Seems to be a recurring theme.",1
45011,I have NEVER received this magazine. I ordered quite a while ago and Amazon said it should have been here by now. I am VERY UPSET!!!,1
45028,"Though I have not received my first issue yet, I have subscribed to Oprah Magazine in the past.  I enjoy the articles which are timely and of interest to women of all ages.",4
45033,What a fantastic offer from Amazon.  I will now always look at Amazon first to order my magazines!,5
45036,How can I review something I have not received?  If Amazon is not going to send me the magazine refund my money!  Should be no star.,1
45062,"I would review this magazine if I received it!  It's been two months, and I have not yet seen one copy.",1
45074,"Ordered two subscriptions in December, here it is Feb 8th and I still have not recieved a copy.",1
45076,All these weeks and I still haven't received my first issue.  I am very disappointed with this whole experience.,1
45091,I ordered my Oprah magazine subscription a month ago now. I still haven't recieved my first issue. Still waiting......,1
45093,I suppose it is ok.  I ordered it on Dec 15th and have not received it as of Jan 17.  I have paid for it so I guess it will show up soon.,3
45098,"Interesting, timely, applicable, varied - all of the above - and all as tastefully done as her show has always been - typical Oprah!",5
45110,I really love O Magazine - it always has great articles and the color photos are excellent quality. Makes for a great gift!!,5
45117,"I bought this subscription for my wife and she enjoys the magazine, but so far each issue is delivered long after it is available in stores.",3
45143,Two year subscription to O- Oprah magazine.  This was the best price I could find anywhere and it was delivered promptly!,5
45152,I was very happy to find such a great deal on one of my favorite magazines. I can't believe I have gotten two issues so soon.,5
45154,Absolutely the best price I've seen anywhere - $24 for 2 years ($12 for a year). Much more affordable than the magazine publisher offers!  ~ Jan,5
45167,I bought a subscription to 0 Magazine for my mom on Mother's Day. She really enjoys it,4
45171,mag not all that good.  not even good enough to go through a second time as I usually do with mags.,1
45175,"This item was ordered as a Mother's Day gift, and has not yet (as of 5/29) been received",1
45178,"The O magazine is great and Amazon offered a great deal.  Great articles, pictures and enjoyable to read.",5

45237,"I am sure this will be a great magazine, but I have not received my first issue yet.",1
45240,"This magazine is wonderful.

It gives me information on fashion, cooking, furniture, etc.

This is the best magazine that is perfect for any woman",5
45249,This is a wonderful magazine it takes me back every time to my roots...love reading it brings back memories and reminds me to make my own with those I love.,5
45280,Always on point with the latest trends. I look forward to every issue!,5
45289,Nothing  more than an ad for surgical procedures.,2
45295,New Beauty mostly advertisement needs more research information.,3
45297,I like magazine..but I think would be better in paper form,2
45301,Products advertised are high end and not affordable to the majority.,1
45305,I like to read all things beauty and so does my daughter.  So this was a good magazine for us.,4
45307,Not enough information on the beauty products. A lot of pictures but no info.  It does have a lot of products,3
45322,Never ordered this,1
45324,Both as a gift but I think it is over priced for all that is in it.,4
45326,my mom loves the magazine,5
45346,Great and easy transaction--fast shipping and product arrived in great condition. I would definitely recommend this seller!,5
45351,I have not received this product and delivery is 6-8 weeks. That is too long as I have already paid for the subscription. I'am not happy !,1
45355,Both my husband and my brother love this magazine.  They can't live without it!,5
45361,great product thx,5
45368,Not what I had hoped it would be.  Did not renew....,2
45380,The quality of this publication has suffered greatly over the years.  I subscribed for years but would not recommend it to anyone now.,2
45386,This magazine does not meet our needs and do not wish to renew.  The magazine of the past was more suitable.,1
45390,Hubby's favorite magazine.  Getting it in the mail is way easier than having to go to Walmart (the only place that carried it) every week!,5
45398,"Not exactly what I expected. Actually not even close. A bunch of crappy ads for surplus military stuff, black guns, etc. I thought I was going to get some news about shotguns.",1
45404,"My hubby loves all the info this thick gun magazine brings. It is by far his favorite for everything ""gun realated""!",5
45410,"I have not received my order of Shotgun news as of yet ???
cannot rate since i haven't received it yet",1
45432,Can do without the sexual covers but this magazine is filled with great information,4
45437,I canceled my subscription.  I think against nudity I just don't like it in my magazine,1
45439,not what I expected. not for retirees,2
45442,Tasteless!!! As bad as a porn magazine. Now i cant have books on here for my kids. Just disgusting!!!!!!!,1
45458,Good magazine with informative articles.,4
45467,Awesome!!,5
45475,"great magazine, Fiance overseas loves it",5
45498,Format difficult to read.,1
45516,"I like some of the articles, but I don't plan on renewing it, since I don't get as much out of it to renew.",3
45526,"Good for those who want to learn more about health, exercises, and beauty.",3
45531,Articles lack real content,3
45542,Not many health articles.,1
45548,This magazine is okay.  Its more ads than anything else but it does have a few good articles. I wouldn't renew.,3
45553,"I will be canceling my new subscription this was not what I was hoping it would be, thankfully I am still within the 30 day trial",1
45558,Great price for a great magazine. I have loved Men and Women's Health for as long as I can remember.,5
45572,"Better than most of the other women's fitness magazines, has more useful information and is less driven by advertisements in general",3
45577,I did not want to buy this it I s not what I like it's not what I look a t,1
45589,"I love this magazine, it is so informative and helpful. It has great articles, tips and facts for any women. Love it and will renew when the time comes",5
45590,"I enjoyed reading the Health magazine, but I won't get it anymore because of the price. $5 a month is way too much.",4
45593,"I'm already paying for the subscription. Why can't I download the magazine under ""current subscriber?"" Many magazines do this. What gives? One star until things change.",1
45603,Not sure if it's my iPad or the mag but does Not seem to be interactive like other magazines. There are play buttons but nothing happens when I push them...,3
45606,Why does Women's Health seem like nothing more than an ad for the latest trendy product or device month after month?,2
45672,"Geared toward under-30 women who already look good. Heavy on the fashion, light on the health.  Would not have purchased had I seen a preview.",2
45703,This magazine provides good information on health issues and exercises tips. The only drawback is that there are a numerous amount of advertisements.,1
45721,To much advertising. Not enough information. Will not renew.,3
45728,I like this magazine but have received only one issue since subscribing a few months ago. That's why I gave it one star.,1
45730,Mostly for weight control with diabetes. Good recipes,3
45734,Great magazine for diabetics just far too many advertisements.,3
45744,"Great magazine!  This is one of the best magazines for people living with diabetes.  Very informative, good recipes too!",5
45745,"Some good recipes that I will us, many that I will not due to my tastes.",3
45747,"one of my favorite magazines. I read it from cover to cover and then read it again.
  I just wish it came out monthly- its a long time between issues",5
45762,Too many ads very expensive for ordinary people,1
45767,Read above. I have tried other magazines about diabetes and this one is tops. I have suggested to friends and family.,5
45769,"great magazine, I am really enjoying the recipes and the great information, also the colorful pictures. One of the best magizines ever.",5
45778,Just love this informative book. Came ahead of time also.  Has alot of helpful info on managing diabetes. Recommend it,5

45879,Just full of all kinds of info!  Fun and educational ! Love it !,5
45887,Some good information,3
45903,Informative but couldn't get into the lifestyle.,3
45926,"Wonderful magazine. Wide variety of subjects. How about some Northeast camping that's not all Maine seacoast. Talk about Upper NY, Vt., NH.",4
45928,Not the magazines fault but I thought it would be more based upon travel trailer reviews and less about destinations to go visit.,2
45939,"while we have found tips  in this magazine, it appears to be mostly for people in bigger rigs and more expensive rigs. it does have some nice articles about places to go.",3
45946,"I don't know why I was asked to review this. I've yet to see a copy. Maybe someday it will come, until then it's less than one star.",1
45953,"Got this two years in a row for my sis in law. She is obsessed with cooking and her, so it is always a hit and for 20 bucks how can you go wrong.",4
45954,Great Deal and love Paula Deen's recipes which are easy and delicious.  Paula Deen is always a five rating in my opinion.,5
45957,I love Paula Dean and her magazine is great also and a good deal on the price from amazon,5
45967,"I am looking forward to receiving the magazine, BUT it's taking 2-1/2 months to receive the first issue!",3
45973,"I prefer Classic Bike, maybe because I lean towards old, Brit Bikes. I've only seen 1 issue, perhaps the next ones will be more to my liking.",3
45981,I enjoy the articles . The mind/brain is amazing,4
45984,Dense with information on a vast variety of topics. Well worth every penny.,5
45985,Very interesting stuff!,4
45988,I enjoy this magazine and usually take a copy with me on trips.  It is one of the few magazines in which (almost) every article is interesting and thought provoking.,4

46003,"Love it the articles on brain physiology, chemical balances, behaviors and emotions and how they interact with society is
excellent. Content the best.",5
46006,I love this magazine. It is always interesting and well written.,5
46028,"Bought this magazine for my dad, he loves it. It comes on time every month and he eats it up as soon as it arrives.",5
46037,I've read the reviews where it's nothing but fluff.  I still enjoy it.  If we didn't have pretenious people in the world we wouldn't know what pretenious was.,4
46040,I once subscribe for this magazine through Amazon and never recieve it. I love this magazine so I now buy it in my nearest library.,1
46047,Anyone interested in how the mind works can't help but be fascinated by nearly every article in each issue.,4
46051,There were not many good articles in here.,2
46066,This is the first time I have subscribed to this magazine.  I really like the article topics but wish that there was more data included to back the articles.,4
46080,"Magazine is good, however Kindle support is very poor. God help you if you have to call Amazon.",1
46082,Limited (boring) articles; too many advertisements; worthless. I will not renew.,1
46083,Some interesting reading ..,4
46096,I purchased this magazine and I can not get it to show up in my kindle?  What good does it do to buy print & Kindle when you can not use it?,1
46103,"mot for me, just coin prices, not to much about coins",1
46111,This magazine is a must have for any coin collector.  The monthly price guide is great. The articles are informative and fun to read.,5
46116,It is probably most in depth monthly magazine on the market with good market price guides. Wish they had more categories of grades and more of current year pricing.,4
46164,Great Mag.,5
46166,This mag is great for those just getting into handloading and for veterans of reloading as well. Don't  know of any better mag.,5
46182,Overall the magazine is pretty good. Easy reading. Gives me something to do for about 15 min's a month. Came during the time advertised.,4
46194,Makes me feel like less of a man to read this stupid magazine.  Advertisements and fluff articles.  Like Martha Stewart Living and the New Yorker for suburban men.  No thanks.,1
46201,The format makes it hard to read. I had not read for several years and the articles are not as informative as in years past.,1
46211,not what I expected.,2
46215,Very disappointed nothing like the past outdoor life magazines will not re-order,1
46228,I have never been a subscriber. They spam me every day. I hate them.,1
46235,"I ordered wrong magazine. Thought I ordered Outdoor magazine. NOt interested in hunting, guns, etc.",1
46241,"Great magazine for anyone who enjoys hunting,fishing and outdoor activities.",5
46242,Great magazine over a lot of years!,5
46243,not what it used to be.,3
46244,good price but got duplicate issues.,3
46255,A good read for the outdoors-man.  I wish they had more articles covering western mule deer and elk.,4
46262,Great Magazine At A Great Price!,5
46272,Good magazine for the outdoorsman.,4
46282,Perhaps I mixed this up with a similar magazine but the first 2 issues we received very totally devoted to a few areas that have no interest to us,1
46287,It's just a shell of what it used to be years ago.  Doesn't appear to be of much value now.,1
46288,I've been reading Outdoor life since I was a kid. I really enjoy the tips and new ideas it comes up with. I just wished it focused as much on the south as it does the midwest.,4
46303,Too many ads not enough content,2
46306,I have bee a reader since the 60's and it is not nearly as good as in the past! The size and content is much smaller.,3
46310,grandson enjoyed it.,4
46326,"Mostly it appears to be just a long advertising brochure .  Would appreciate more ""how to"" or ""did"" articles without an underlying ad theme.",2
46327,"great magazine. my bro loves the articles and the gift. He spends all the time he can in the woods, so this is the perfect magazine for him. yeah!",5
46328,"The actual magazine is great when you get it.  Some months go by with nothing, then a couple show up at once.",3
46330,"Great magazine, but I didn't want to renew but it did automatic. I didn't like that wished I would of know.",3
46342,"Wow... so this is what a ""magazine"" with 99% ads looks like... Cosmo isn't this bad, please don't waste your money.",1
46368,I have NOT RECEIVED any copies of this magazine from the publisher as of  today's date  (01-17-2013).  It seems to take a while to get the subscription process rolling.,1
46381,"Some gear comparisons; some nice pictures - overall it's not bad for the money ($5 per year).
Something to glance through while having your cup of coffee.",4
46383,"I grew up with Outdoor Life and Jack O'Connor, etc.  I didn't realize how it has shrunk over the years. It's quite thin. Fewer pages.",2
46423,"I don't have an old house, but I enjoyed the book and learned a few things that will help with any age house",4
46429,Nice but not what I was looking for.,2
46447,I was pretty excited to find this magazine online and wanted to subscribe until I read ALLOW 12-16 weeks for delivery.  Columbus could have delivered the magazine sooner.,3
46462,Clearly not a mag for middle income people.  Even the recipes have ingredients that your local grocery store is not likely to carry.,1
46463,It's not a bad magazine but it sure could be better. My real complaint is that every where and everything they recommend/suggest/etc. is well beyond most peoples financial realm,3
46472,Lots of ads. Like a little vacation.,3
46473,I like this magazine.,4
46488,Not as good a mag as it used to be,3
46495,My favorite magazine at an incredible price!,5
46498,This was a gift for my wife and she has enjoyed it.,4
46499,I enjoy coastal living but which there was more editorial. Too much emphasis on photos rather than quality editorial content.,4
46504,Liked the magazine very much.  Decided to get a subscription!,4
46509,Did not meet my expectations.,1
46510,"Its really nice just extremely THIN!  If it gets much thinner, it will have to be called a Periodical.",3
46512,Very disappointed. It's nothing more than an advertisement for international resorts.....I will not renew.,1
46533,It's a lot of very expensive stuff. I live near the beach but I can't afford a $500 umbrella stand.,3
46536,"My vision of great vacations is anywhere on the water or near the shore, so this magazine gives me a glimpse of that throughout the year. Love it!",5
46546,A lovely but 'skinny' magazine.  Would have wished for a more substantial one.  What it does provide however is interesting.,3
46549,Too much advertisement,2
46555,Best magazine for anyone who loves the coastal way of life!,5
46565,"Disappointed.  Way too many advertisements.
We own a vintage beach house. I was hoping for more articles on average coastal homes and towns. Not just high dollar properties.",2
46567,"A little more island living than Hamptons living, which is why I wanted it, but great ideas nonetheless.",4
46571,"Even though I don't live on the coast, we visit North Padre Island fairly often, and we lived near Corpus for many years.  I will probably renew this one.",4

46632,Tried to cancel,4
46642,Boring. Other magazines do it better.,2
46652,"Beautiful magazine but I stopped my subscription because print copy is 10.00 yearly, and Kindle edition is 19.99! The difference is too much!",2
46653,awesome magazine.,5
46660,way too many ads and way too little information.,3
46661,Best magazine! If I could only get one magazines e this would be it! Full of great decorating ideas along with amazing recipes and so much more!,5
46677,I only gave Coastal Living Magazine 4 stars because there are a few too many ads throughout the magazine but I will subscribe for at least one year.,4

49152,I only got 1 issuse,1
49153,This is 1/4 the size of the regular cosmo,1

49186,Mistake.  Not for me.,1
49189,Needs more sex and less politics.,1
49195,It's just not the same as reaping a real magazine. I read a lot of e-book and love them but I would never get another magazine online.,1
49200,I have had this subscription for 10 years now and will continue to be a loyal customer...this is by far my favorite magazine,5

49265,What girl doesn't love Cosmo and a glass of wine! Have been reading this forever. Even caught my boyfriend reading it!,5
49268,I've loved this mag. Since I was young. I love even more the e-reader version. No paper wasted!  I wish it did have a page selection. To go back and forth.,5
49276,Maybe I'm getting too old for this magazine... I don't know (I'm 28). I feel like half the magazine is advertisements. It's just so-so.,3
49277,good magazines,3
49280,Difficult to navigate on kindle fire compared to other magazines.,3
49290,Great price for cosmopolitan. Love it,5

49311,Teen girls STILL love this magazine!,5
49312,It came on time. Not that interested in the articles.,3
49328,"Cosmo is the best magazine ever! A great mix of fashion, sex and commentary.",5
49336,Too many ad's and not enough articles. Many years ago when I read Cosmopolitan they had some informative articles I do not find this is the case any longer.,3
49337,Crappy articles. Tons of ads,1
49344,"This magazine publishes the same thing. I think I probably only subscribed for a cute bag, most of the magazines went straight to the recycling bin.",2
49350,my wife likes this magazine,4
49351,Always loved this one!,5
49356,TOO YOUNG FOR ME,4

49379,Cancelled. Too much filth,1
49381,good magazine!,4
49386,Cosmo magazine.  Fun silly read with a little fashion mixed in.,4

49399,"Awesome sex tips, funny stories, sexy pictures, great workouts, and a decent price for one! I loved using it on my amazon tablet!",5

49431,"I paid, I did not receive. I forgot about it. Too many ads anyways. I never received a single issue of the one year subscription",1
49436,I would highly suggest Cosmo to anyone. I get it right to my doorstep every month and love it. Very good $ too.,5
49454,This magazine used to be a great read but now it seems to be all smut.  Really to not like it anymore.,2
49458,Sex every single page. Seriously this magazine needs to arrive in a black bag because it is comparable to porn.,1
49459,"Mostly fluff articles, a few hidden gems . Overall it's just mindless entertainment. I've been reading it since I was a teenager.",3
49460,I love this magazine so much such a great one. I look forward to getting mine in the mail every month.,5
49463,"Same crap inside every month and the fashion stinks. The products are all too expensive. There's nothing new inside, no new hairstyles, makeups, techniques; all old.",1
49464,"I love my subscription to Cosmo! I get it on time every month. I love reading this again, It is so interesting and this is a great deal.",5
49465,"I was not satisfied with this because I never even received a single magazine from this purchase, tried to report it twice nothing was done.",1

49484,I got this one year subscription on sale for $5 and I am very happy with it. Getting it in the mail is a plus!,5
49495,"I do not enjoy receiving the magazine after I already see it at the store. I thought if you ordered it in the mail, you will get it a little BEFORE all of the stores.",3
49504,I ordered this subscription and never received even one issue. I don't even understand how it's possible that they could charge my Dad's card for it.,1
49505,"I think it's geared more for the younger generation!  If you're in your twenties or thirties, it woud be great!",3
49513,I love this magazine. And I received this year subscription for less then $15. Saving me a lot of money yearly! Always such good articles!!,5
49550,every thing is fine  but who cares  16words?  please cancel my order  how about  please cancel mY order  cancel my order  i made the 16 word  DO YOU GET IT,1
49551,Just wanted to renew the subscription and are now getting two at a time.  I guess I need to call and get this fixed.,1
49560,i got a year of this for only 5 dollars what a deal it beats paing 4 dollars each month at the store,5
49563,I really enjoy reading these magazines and it was very convenient on my kindle but I just cant justify paying the same price as for a physical copy.,4
49567,This was a wonderful deal and an awesome magazine. I would get this again if the opportunity presented itself. It was the best price I had ever gotten on the magazine,5
49569,Love love love Cosmo! This is such a great deal. You can't beat one year for $5 and an annual upgrade!,5
49588,I never got it-!!!  now I want my money back but how . hate this carp trying to find where to go to be taken care of,1
49610,Got this subscription from an amazon local deal. Probably not one of my better buys but gives me something to read if I get bored,3
49614,"This is a good magazine for finding health and beauty products but it takes eons to skim through all of the ads to get to these articles, which is why I rated it 3 stars.",3
49616,"I'm officially too old for cosmo... although it's a great magazine, the bf stories and work stories just don't relate to my life... although - love the style ;)",3
49618,Cosmopolitan is an okay magazine not really interesting nothing that I would reccomend just to anyone but it is okay.,3
49620,The first two magazines they sent me were ones i had purchased before I signed up for this subscription so that was a bummer,3
49635,Excellent deal for $5 per year. I have read this magazine for many years. Now that I am nearing 50 it has begun to not appeal to me anymore. Definitly for the younger crowd 18-40.,4
49637,"some good articles a lot of sex talk (it is COSMO) don't love it don't hate it I have read it off and on for many years. Enjoy Redbook,More and a few other",4

49666,"Some articles are targeted more for the single, bimbo chick.but there is a lot of single page stuff on beauty and I like the celebrity comparison hairstyles and stuff",4
49667,It was raining the day my mag was delievered so it was a little wet. In the past I got mags and they came in a clear plastic bag. Prevents the mag from getting wet.,3
49670,I have not received any copies of the magazine yet... They are all out in stores. What's going on? Womp..,1
49672,"I enjoyed Cosmopolitan when I was younger, and I can definately see now that it is for younger women. The magazine is fine, just not age appropriate for me anymore.",3
49673,First off you get it after it hits the news stands which is annyoing. Secondly why can't you just do a yearly subscription? Don't recommend at all,2
49705,"I love Cosmo magazine, but I ordered it last month and I got a postcard saying I wouldn't get one until July. I am not very happy with that.",2

52109,Why are the same people featured over and over again in these magazines? I'm tired of hearing of kim and her obvious plastic surgeries!,3
52120,People requires you to have the print edition to have the digital edition.  I don't have the print edition so I could never read the digital edition.,1
52130,FUN and easy to read! I usually read Who magazine for some escapism but OK was at least as entertaining!!,3
52131,"If I could download the issue it may be great. But since I can't, it sucks. I want a refund for all magazines bouGht for kindle from amazon",1

52277,"They should wrap these in plastic because the magazine isn't thick, so everytime my niece gets one it looks like beat up and the pages are torn etc.",2
52324,Good magazine.  Didnt really focus on what I was looking for. That is a magazine strictly about sports bikes but all around OK.,3
52351,Very light reading. Maybe only 5-6 articles an issue. You get what you pay for,3
52357,BEWARE!-Its NOT 12 issues as advertised. My last two issues were for DEC/JAN and FEB/MARCH. Cycle World doing the same.,3

52412,Good overall magazine.  Some helpful articles. I do look forward to reading it every month.,4
52422,Not a bad price for it.,4
52423,It cannot even compare to it's former self.  I have saved stacks of Women's Days from the 70s and 80s.  I will not save one of these issues - nothing worthwhile.,1
52425,Very redundant from month to month...thought it would be more interesting but it literally just feels like every page is advertising something.,2
52430,My mom loves these magazines and I had ordered them for her Mother's Day gift. I am very happy with the service we received and I know she is very happy as well!,5
52440,Yes I love this magazine can't wait to get the rest of them,5

52492,Who could not love this magazine?,5
52505,"This magazine just doesn't contain much photo content. I would have liked more issues and more content in each issue.
Generally speaking,  I was disappointed.",3
52512,It's an OK magazine for the price. Good things in it but it isn't great  quick read and a few good recipes or ideas.,3

52597,awesome magzine,5
52601,Have already ordered this in another order.  Don't need any more.  Thanks.,3
52604,Photography magazines offer a great learning experience. This one is no exception. Even the advertising shows great photography.  These always arrived timely in great condition.,5
52609,"I recomend it, the articles were interesting, relevant and inspiring, I will continue with the suscription  as soon as posible",4
52625,I used to get this magazine years ago and liked it. Now it's all ads. Gone to pot. Very disappointed as I was giving it as a gift.,1
52630,Decent magazine that has a few tips but most of the magazine is ads. The reviews are pretty good but nothing you couldn't find at [...],3
52657,More for the runabout owner ..,3
52661,"magazine is okay, was sent old issues.",3
52663,Love it.  Thank you.,5
52666,I'm trying to give Woman's Day the benefit of the doubt......too many ads so far...not much reading.  Will have to see what other issues are like.,3

52694,The Kindle format of BOATING is the same quality as the original print format.,4
52697,Decent magazine with informative articles,3
52701,One of the best.,5

52704,This magazine was just ok.,3
52705,I love this magazine. Great info and I read it cover to cover.,2
52707,Trying to cancel this subscription.  Same every month--just different recipes.  Not much to it.,2
52713,i remember this magazine being alot better 10 years ago... its not so great anymore... i won't be reviewing,3
52720,I hadn't read Woman's Day in a while. I found the variety of topics interesting and enjoyable to read.,4
52729,Good magazine at a good price. Fairly quick delivery. I would recommend it to anyone interested in lifestyle magazines. It is one of the few good ones left.,4
52731,"Not much information, magazine is getting thinner every year. Not worth the price. What else can be said about it",2
52737,Not enough content of food and other interesting articles for me.  I mainly went to the mag for Clinton Kellys info which was a short piece.  I probably would not subscribe,3
52739,It is certainly not the Women's Day that we purchase in the shops was not impressed just pages and pages of advertisements no stories,1
52741,I love this magazine. lots and lots of great recipes and craft ideas. There are also a lot of self help information,5
52759,I love that this magazine has a little bit of everything in it. I especially love the recipes. They are always fantastic.,5

52787,"I like this magazine for the recipes. I want quick, great tasting, easy to prepare recipes.  Life is good when the family gets great taste and I get out of the kitchen.",4
52788,This magazine is like reading the same thing over and over again every month. When is this magazine going to get some new material?,2
52791,This was a gift to my wife for mothers' day. She wasn't a regular consumer of the mag but seems to enjoy it. Good buy!,4
52794,Rehash of old recipes and household hints.  Would not read it even if it is given to me.  Waste of my time.,1
52795,"I grew up reading Woman's Day and to this day enjoy all the articles, recipes, etc.  Good magazine and not too expensive.",3
52811,I think magazine these days just have too many advertizements and so few other content to look at.  The ads in this magazine have too many also.,3
52817,"Would rather have the magazine in my hands
Would not buy another magazine. Sorry just
did not enjoy it. just me!",1
52823,"Seems well thoughtout and am looking forward to the next issue
We found some good recipies to try --always a plus",4
52828,"Its ok. Wish it had alot of manufacturing coupons. Very thin magazine, too much advertizements! Better than other magines that I get",3
52833,I have read this magazine since I was a teen....and at 40 I stil find it as good as it was back then!,4
52840,Cheaper than buying it every month at the grocery store!  Can't wait to start receiving it by mail every month.,5
52852,But I haven't received it yet since ordering it through you a long time ago!  I've never seen it take so long to get a subscription started.,1
52856,I would reccomend this Woman's Day to my Mom and sisters.  Woman's Day has a variety of subjects that entertain you for hours.,4

52860,"I love, love, love this magazine!  It never fails to disappoint me.  There is something for everyone in this publication!",5

52924,"Great covers, insightful and well written articles!",4
52937,I am a hardcore conservative but I find it to be a thoughtful and interesting read.  out!,4
52945,Best writing around.  Much nicer companion than the New Yorker.,5
52961,Had the article in it I wanted to read.,4
52972,Suddenly the content moved from Centris to Left / Progressive and from unbiased truthful reporting to biased propaganda.  I canceled.,1
52978,"It liberal, bias trash that belong in the garbage dump.",1
52984,Thoughtful brilliant writing. Best of magazines.,5
52996,Pay for ads..wtf,1
53003,Any magazine that lets a blatant racist like Donald Trump on their cover doesn't deserve any subscriptions. Make America Smart Again.,1

53009,I am dumber for having looked at this.,1
53020,"Lost, Do not purchase",1

53124,This magazine was a great Kindle read one afternoon with reading time!  The formatting for the kindle was also excellent.,5
53133,This has got to be one of the poorest written magazines I have ever taken the time to read. Especially in kindle form.,1

Not all articles were of interest to me. Well written.",3
53158,Great writing by insightful and thought provoking people.  And now I can get it on my Kindle. I love this magazine.,5
53162,I like articles about modern philosophy but I would like to get it more. Jurnal is focus at US. I would like to see more authors from Europe.,3
53164,"I always enjoy the different perspectives of The Atlantic, I wish there would be more editions every year instead of ten.  I also enjoy the web page.",4

53236,The magazine itself is great.  I got this as a gift for my mother.  It keeps coming to my house even though I've changed the shipping address.,3
53239,"I like the magazine, would like to see a larger variety of dcor styles.  Most of the dcor is modern or industrial.",4
53243,I haven't read magazines in a long time. I ordered this one as I am purchasing a new home and wanted ideas. So far the magazine seems a little short on that.,3
53245,What can I say? One of the best decorating mags around.,5
53249,Nice for inspiration but very high-end in terms of the products that are featured...,3
53250,It is an OK magazine but will not reorder.,3
53269,Great having the mag in line!,4
53273,I love and enjoy reading this magazine.,4

53332,"I did not receive it!  If I did, where is it?  I subscribed to this magazine because I love all thing ""Elle.""",1
53345,Style is very traditional. I find Veranda present rooms more to my liking. If you can find it House and Home (Canadian) is wonderful.,2
53354,"this is a beautiful magazine.  Seems to be written for the rich and famous and their designers.  Enjoy the pics, but not very useful for the average, retired and downsized person.",3
53360,The styles are a little too funky for me.  I like things that match more or use the same color palettes.,3
53369,"This magazine was way overpriced.  It was not at all what I expected.  Huge disappointment.

Will not purchase a second time.",1
53370,Fantastic trial price! There's always plenty of inspiration in the magazine. I appreciate the fast service when ordering magazines through this site.,5
53371,"Elle Decor doesn't feel organic enough or accessible for those of us on a limited budget. Gorgeous pictures, but not applicable for the average design oriented ""Jane.""",3

53373,Love this magazine. Always reviews the latest trend and I can count on Elle to introduce new designers. Thank you.,5
53381,I always enjoy receiving my Elle to check out all the hottest styles and home trends and decor - I love it,5
53382,"Not what I thought I was buying. Too many advertisements. Pictures of people I don't know, no idea where to purchase items",2
53384,This magazine has some very pretty pictures; that's all. I guess it works fine for people with money but It doesn't do anything for me.,3
53392,"This magazine gives great ideas and inspiration for design and decor.
It is, by far my favorite decorating magazine ever!",5
53398,I bought this for my niece who's in her twenties. She moved into a new apt and absolutely loves it!,5
53400,There seems to be only pics in magazine.. no real articles and even the pics are not of interest to me.. . did not find it useful,1
53401,"I received my first issue and it's just rubbish. It's relatively thin for a magazine, and it's just full of advertisement and hardly any contents.",1
53406,"The magazine has great, up to date ideas for all parts of your house - inside and out!  Love it.",5
53422,"Good decorating ideas; however a little fancy. The subscription is only 10 issues per year, however, so it seemed like each one took a little while to arrive",4
53441,"Elle Decor - simply the best.  Wonderful, eclectic decor - sophisticated, original, beautiful, always.  Inspirational, thoughtful.  The best American decorating magazine.",5
53443,"I won't be renewing. Lots of ads and extreme prices. Pretty pics and few good ideas, but will try House Beautiful next time.",3
53444,If you are like me there is no such thing as too many decorating magazines.  I have subscribed to this one for years and it is well worth the price.,5
53469,I love this magazine! I read it faithfully. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the issues are not long enough.,1
53484,I only received one issue!!!!!!!! Then received a bill to renew!! Not Happy!!,1
53486,"Nothing I can't find online/Pinterest.  Only got one so far but wasn't wowed by it, glad I only paid 1.99 :)",2

53527,Nice articles and projects.  Many years ago I subscribed to the magazine.  I'm glad I did again..,4
53529,"Started getting my magazines already! Loving them. Fab price as well. Lots of neat things, ideas and such inside. Def worth keeping.",5

53588,Good content .,4
53622,"had seen the magazine inthe doctors office, So decided to order,. Very pleased. Liked the craft info thats in them",4
53625,I enjoyed this issue very much and I am looking forward to seeing more.  Will probably purchase this for my daughter also.,4

53905,Needs to have a page with channel codes.,3
53906,"I DO NOT LIKE THE FORMAT, I THINK IT IS COMPLICATED AND SHOULD BE SPREAD OUT MORE AND NOT SO BUNDLED UP.  LIKE THE VERY OLD TV GUIDE USED TO BE",2

54933,"They don't have a listing for during the day, which is when I normally watch TV.  Disappointed, so I won't be renewing my subscription.",2
54934,very happy with subscription and the pricing is great,5
54936,"Waste of money, not for my region.",1
54946,Good pictures and recipes but way to much advertising.,3
54953,The only problem is that there is no information about the A.M. programming.,3
54954,I find the listing of daily programs hard to read  on my iPad,3
54963,not a interesting as i thought it would be,3
54964,Not not as much content as before,3
54981,"One of the best magazines, hands down, and has been for decades",5
54985,"A wonderful magazine for food, plants, and anything else you want to know about the South!",5
54989,"I don't have the Kindle part, but it may not come on the Kinle Paperwhite.  Got the magazine last week for this weeks shows.",3
54996,Our daily paper often differs from what is listed in TV Guide.  And  it's usually correct. Why is this?  I can't rely on the TV Guide listings.,3
55001,"I have not received the kindle edition. So, as far as I'm concerned,  the purchase has not happened and I was ripped off.",1
55006,"Never a problem with issues, when I renew through Amazon for the past three [3] years.  Highly recommend magazine renewals.",5
55014,"Love Southern Living! I've been a subscriber for years. Decorating ideas, and recipes the best!",5
55017,It turns out I never have time to watch TV so this was a useless purchase for me. If you have time to watch TV and want to know what's on then this is the purchase or you!,2
55023,"Not current show times.  Only shows from 7pm posted,  Not useful.  Not easy to use. Very disappointed.  Needs to more like old TV Guide.",2

55051,Southern Living has been one of my most favorite magazines for years!,5
55053,Have taken it for years and love it.,5
55064,The  T V  Guide  is a nice  way to get stories about  T V  personalities.  However it is not worth the  retail price but is the price I paid,4
55077,"It's not that I hate it...on the contrary, I love this magazine...but I don't remember ordering it and never received any copies if I did",1
55079,"Love this magazine. It isn't all advertisement, and I truly learn something from every edition. Perfect recipes, too!",5

55083,"Great magazine but as other reviews have said, the print is pretty small.",4
55084,Favorite magazine of all times! But a little expensive.,4
55108,Still like the hard copy best but it's nice to carry my kindle edition in the car.,4
55114,I still have not rec'd my subscription.....!,1
55121,Maybe TV Guide should read its own reviews...definitely not what I was looking for.. I would not recommend it to my friends,1
55123,great buy on an essential magazine for TV viewing.  I will auto-renew every year through Amazon.  Husband and I share it.,5
55126,Great info  the only difficulty is the guide for shows itself is difficult to navigate. But I read it for everything besides the tv listings,4
55133,Great articles.  Interesting read. Thanks the digital version for Android.,4
55143,Exactly like the print magazine in every way. The magazine on the app can be read on or offline once downloaded. I love it!,5
55145,i  like to read the tv guide  i can see whats showing on the dates ahead  thannks for the opportinnity to do that,4
55150,"The southern living magazine font is too small on a Kindle Fire 7"" and does not allow for zooming like other magazines allow.",3
55165,I wanted local broadcast stations did not have them at all. It did not give a list of local statos. I had recently movers to the state and did not have a clue about the stations,1
55171,Did not wish to renew this subscription!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  delete it....stop the subscription..I like to order personally...like to make my own choices to renew,1
55175,I Ordered this Mag for my mom as she couldn't afford it anymore. And she is very happy with it.,5
55181,"The only text that can be enlarged for reading is the adds. The text for the articles is tiny, disappointing.",1
55186,not at all what I thought it would be I did not like it sorry,1
55187,"I don't want nto auto enew. It is no value to me. Please cancel it. it is a worhless magazine.

Sincerly John McKean",1
55190,Can't live without my tv guide. Love the stories and love how easy it is to read the nights setup.,5
55198,"National and International News, old Classic Movies and Sports are mostly my interest, so I find TV Guide of limited value.",3
55200,Fun reading but only shows prime time schedules would like better if it had a full days schedule.  Great price.,4
55207,I love Southern Living! I have subscribed since the late 80s and loved every issue!,5
55212,did not automatically renew - still waiting,1
55218,"Often the listings are incorrect. In addition, there is no general daytime schedule for the weekdays or for the  weekend.",2
55219,Love TV Guide. Great price. Can't be beat and let's me know when time to renew. Same price from last year was wonderful.,5
55273,I just love what southern living magazine is all about. The wonderful stories to the awesome recipes.,5
55281,"Not accurate, some shows play at times not listed.  Far too much advertising and B.S.
It's a good thing the price was low.",3
55287,"I buy this yearly for my mother who depends on her TV for much of her entertainment.
I know she really enjoys it and is commenting on many of the articles.",4
55291,I have received this magazine for many years and it helps me set up the DVR for the week. I circle the programs that I am going to program.,4
55292,it is nothing but 7:00PM to 11:00PM. Is not worth the money!!! Don't waste your money or your time on this item!!!,1
55293,"I ordered a large print version of TV Guide and when it came, it was not large print.  I am dissatisfied.",1
55295,I don't like it because it has. Only prime time and no daytime guide. I like having all daytime also.,1
55302,Awful way to look at the magazine. Text doesn't enlarge as this app does not support this magazine. Buy only if you want to get frustrated,4
55316,This magazine is nothing but adds and hardly any TV programing information. You call two hours a day from 8-10 of nightly programs tv information?,1
55318,I love Southern Living.  It's not quite what it used to be but it has gotten some better.  Will always love reading it for recipes and vacation ideas.,4
55320,The best magazine out there.,5
55321,I can't get it to open so it's useless to me.,1
55322,One of the best magazines I've read! It took me a couple of hours to read through the entire magazine since I didn't want to miss a thing. This is a keeper!,5
55337,"I love Southern Living, and am a southern girl. What is there not to love? It is a part of myself.",5
55338,"Best magazine ever!!  Love, love the recipes!  Thank you Southern Living! Have subscribed forever and never get rid is any of them.",5
55344,One of my favorite magazines.  I always sit down within an hour of delivery to view the images and read the articles,5
55355,It's a good guide but I wish it had daytime also. I would really like more about sports. The listing for sports is really poor.,4
55372,This was a great deal.  I was very lucky that I found it.  TV Guide is my favorite magazine.  Thank you!,5
55374,had to subscribe to a local one for information that was relevant to me in this local area of florida,1
55399,I wanted a TV guide for my mother that included the morning programs--this guide does not include that-this is why I was dissappointed.,3
55417,"I had some trouble with ISSUE 1 but, now that  the publisher fixed the problem, I am very pleased.  I may cancel my printed copy SOON.",4
55423,Best ever for all cat owners,5
55425,Mostly Ads.  Not a very interesting magazine.  I will not renew.,3
55426,funny- great mag,5
55431,I would like it a lot better if it had a generic daytime schedule. It has a lot of interesting articles about listings.,4
55435,The timeframe for us doesn't work ----- shows from 7 pm to 10 pm; no daytime shows.  But we do like to read the articles and the cheers and jeers.,3
55436,I WAS NEVER WAS ABLE TO DOWNLOAD IT ON MY KINDLE..  YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE.. CAN SOMEONE PHONE ME AND TELL ME HOW?  203 464 2165,1
55439,"I'm just taking my chances with finding something on TV.  Subscription process was ridiculously complex, tried three times to get it started and never happened.",1
55440,I thought that it would have the morning listings.  I would like to see Saturday and Sunday mornings listed in the TV guide.,3
55452,i JUST RECEIVED THIS YESTERDAY SO HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF TIME TO READ.  LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE FINE.,3
55454,I would rather have less celebrity coverage and 24 hour TV listings.  I also miss the Movie Guide they had years ago!,3
55464,"I just receive my first magazine of catser and find it very interesting , I am looking forward for next month magazine",4
55466,For my mom and she loves it,5
55477,Paid too much for Guide. Others have lower prices for the same subscription.  Should have does additional shopping.  Guide is as advertised.,3
55478,"What a great deal, the print version and digital on kindle fire.  Glad I found this and the price was great.",5
55484,"I love this magazine,  especially the recipes,  gardening tips and home design.  I've subscribed to it for years and am glad to have access to it on my kindle.",5
55486,This is one of my favorite magazines. The photography is beautiful. The articles are interesting and well written. I love how the Southern esthetic can be used in upstate NY.,5
55507,"Loving this! A friend told me about it, so I just had to get my own subscription!",5
55509,Excellent product and transaction!!!,5
55539,Gift for my niece who is a cat fanatic - she loves it.  Thanks for the great deal!,5
55542,"The main reason I wanted TV Guide was to get advance notice as to when TV shows would be coming on.  TV Guide is not very accurate on this especially on their ""double"" issues.",3
55561,I anxiously await the delivery of each new TV Guide.  I mark the shows I want to watch for the week or two and I love the Puzzles too.  Fun magazine and one of my favorites.,5
55563,"Ordered Nov. 14 & have still not recieved my first isse-1 1/2 months ,are you kidding me. I could see 3 weeks maybe.",1
55564,I haven't received my first issue yet but I saw a copy and it'll do. I just wish they had daytime listings,3
55576,"This and Dogster magazine are both great. Catster has everything cat related...articles, toys, product recommendations, fun stuff.",5
55577,OK articles. Should contain more  information on specific breeds.,3
55586,You Can't Rely On The Information In It .And I Had To Go Through 68 Pages Before I Got To The Schedule The Schedule Only Covers 8-11PM Events.,2
55587,How long does it take to update my subscription?  This is taking a very long time to update my subscription.,1
55589,I also have not received my TV Guide.  Bought it for my husband as one of his Christmas gifts.  Oh well.....lesson learned.,1
55592,"Great recipes and location reviews. Highly recommended. Also, great gardening tips. One of the best magazines out there. Always current.",5
55600,My wife and My mother have been reading and living Southern Living for years. I get to enjoy the great food.,5
55603,"I did not start getting it yet, taking a long time, hope I start getting it soon, looking for it to start",1
55605,Hard to use. Poorly set up and not as good as what the newpaper puts out. I guess I wanted someting like the guide used to be.,2
55617,Have only received one issue so far but like it. Lots of ads for cat products.,1
55620,"I ordered this for my 7 year old, and he loves this magazine. He gets so excited every time a new issue arrives. Great for anyone who loves cats.",5
55623,Southern Living - what is not to love about food from the South and other interesting things happening in and around the South.,5
55639,I subscribed for years but doesn't live up to its name anymore.  Very limited television show listings - covers prime time only and limited channels.  Not very useful.,1
55648,We are cat lovers and thoroughly enjoy the magazine.  We read every article in every issue really love them.  There is always something new to learn and something to laugh at.,5
55653,Only gotten two or three magazines and that's it. I paid for a year not a month. What's the deal?????,1
55661,"This magazine covers everything I'm about ... Gardening, my home decor and some of the best recipes around. we keep ours around forever.",5
55700,I LOVE CATS,5
55704,It took them ages to come out with a digital edition and then to only be on the Kindle Fire and iOS (the second most popular mobile OS). Fail.,1
55717,"After shopping the web thoroughly as I always do when purchasing anything on line, Amazon was found to have the best price, simple as that.",5
55719,"Guess Im not waiting that long to get it. I understand that it has lost its appeal, never change a good thing!",1
55724,gift - they love it,5
55744,My Southern Living  arrived quickly. Wonderful value for those of us who love Southern Living. Everyone have a Blessed Day.,5
55745,"This is one magazine I simply can't live without.  Great places to go, wonderful decorating, recipes to save and the gardening is my favorite.",5
55758,TV Guide is only available in Kindle Fire.  It would be nice if I could get it on my Kindle 3.  What a shame.,1
55764,I love cats!  I love Catster!  I was able to snag this magazine at an amazing price!  I look forward to receiving my issues of this magazine!!!,5

55814,I am a transplanted northerner and I absolutely love getting my Southern Living magazine every month. The lay-out is fantastic and the recipes are yummy !,5

56762,June issue teaching tweens how to have anal sex!  Definitely not appropriate for young teens.,1
56763,"This is gross, gives children explicit advice about having anal sex. This magazines grooms children for sexual abuse.",1
56764,This magazine is nothing more the ads and propaganda. Trying to reach our vulnerable children and teach them about secularism. Sick sick.,1
56765,Nasty publication.,1
56779,"They regularly run articles promoting, normalizing and facetiously advising on abortion for teenagers.  Not something I will EVER let a daughter read.",1
56782,This was totally inappropriate for a young teenager. Articles about sex and female masturbation.,1
56785,Not at all appropriate for teens!!!!!!  I was absolutely shocked at the content!  I would NEVER allow our almost 13 daughter to read this magazine!!!!  Totally disappointed!,1
56811,All advertisements..no articles,2
56820,girls love it,5
56827,My daughter loves it! Just wish it came every month.,4
56838,Nothing but ads.  My daughter really didn't like it at all.,1
56840,"Bought for a 14 year old - she doesnt care for the mag. at all.  Too many ads, and fashion that is not realistic for young teens - cost and modesty too.",2
56843,Not as good as Seventeen. Most product introduce/advertise in this magazine are towards to the higher end (upscale) market which most teen does not have the ability to purchase.,2
56858,"too advanced/suggestive for pre-teen-11-12 yr old- clothes ok, articles not for young readers",2
56862,BOught for a family member she loves it,5
56872,ordered this for my 13 year old daughter. she loves getting magazines in the mail. it so cute to watch her look at them,5
56874,Would not recommend!  Very dissappointed in the magazine. I cancelled It.  It is all product advertisement. Good if you are looking for product choices.,1
56882,"Bought this for my niece who loves fashion, she likes it and the clothes, has a lot of ads in it.",4
56887,"I like the magazine, i just didn't got it on the mail... I paid for this 2 year teen vogue issues and got 5 of them (2 of them were repeated). Not happy.",1
56928,I can't believe people will buy this for their teenage girls as young as 12 & 13 & every other coveron the magazine talks about sex.  No way my child will be reading this trash.,1
56934,I have not received the magazine yet and my daughter is pissed!,1
56938,"If you like any off road magazines, this one is a must.  Great rock crawling coverage.  Nice and thick!",5
56949,It must be VERY difficult to put a name on a list and put something in the mail.  I got two subscriptions via Amazon and neither has arrived yet.  Very frustrating.,1
56952,This is one of the best magazines out there. The articles and advice are good. I really enjoy the jokes and the 10 Things You Don't Know About Women features every month.,4
56953,"Do not like the digital format and too many advertisements. I was a big fan of the printed magazine, wish it had better formating.",1
56957,This magazine has become way too precious for my tastes. I miss the really gritty fiction and raunchy humor.,3
56965,"Garbage. All ads, all unrealistic fashions. Liberal hit pieces on Trump.",1
56967,Very left wing biased publication. Not that that's a bad thing but I prefer middle of the road and didn't know this was such a politically biased magazine.,2
56978,The best magazine on the market,5
56996,too much advertising,3
56997,"This mag is losing it high quality of yesteryear. Trying to keep up with the trends of stoopid young people is just that, a trend, not longevity.",3
57009,Love the mag. Wish the online subscription was included like GQ.,4
57014,Good product. Fast shipping.,4
57016,"It was ok, not that great.",3
57017,Meh!  Hardly any real men in this magazine.  They have a way of even taking a tough guy and just making him look like sulking prissy guy.,1
57021,"The online magazine is very easy to read.  The articles are always interesting, and diversified.  I would highly recommend this format.",5
57024,"i renewed thinking it was extending my current issue, instead, i am getting duplicate issues. not happy with it.i probably will let my subscriptions  expire.",4
57027,"I've been a Esquire reader over three years,when my subscription came due,this was a great price for a legendary magazine!",5
57034,its been 3 months and I only got one issue,1
57038,Esquire has lost some of it's standards over the years.  I feel it has lost some of it quality with very few interesting articles.,3
57042,"Bar none, best writing of any current magazine and I'm a girl.",5
57049,Bad format for kindle. Love the content still; no judgment on the magazine itself. I'll just buy the print copy.,1
57051,Disappointed that it isn't full screen on my Fire HD. I typically have to zoom each page for comfortable reading,2
57063,"I haven't receive any issues yet, though I've been looking. What's up ?  You are getting a bit pushy and confusing  se ya",1
57080,there was supposed to be an email to the recipient to indicate this was a gift  -  did not happen,1
57086,the magazine has some good articles but really does not suit me but I am 74 years old and perhaps not interested in much of the advertising and articles.,3
57089,"There are some very good articles that make for an enjoyable read. Some are pretty in depth and provide an option to the daily news in newspapers, tv, etc.",4
57092,Great magazine with lots of different articles. Very enjoyable and easy to read. Worth the money for a yearly subscription.,4
57104,This magazine covers all the essentials of staying up with men's fashion and interesting subjects that fulfill our inquiring minds.,4
57105,"better than most other choices out there
can be better but for now I like it
you will enjoy for once reading different magazine and this is one",4
57109,"Some pretty good articles, some good fashion, easy reading before bed time.  And for that price, who gives a darn.",4
57118,"For $5, it's hard to complain. I like most of the articles, but sometimes they tend to showcase expensive clothes/shoes that don't seem to be worth their price tag.",4
57121,"this is a good ""mens"" magazine with a lot of good articles and fashion advice for men. The price very reasonable.",4
57122,I ended up not reading it cause I found it hard to read on the kindle. I prefer good old magazines.,3
57124,Just received my first issue...earlier than expected...enjoy this magazine much!  I like reading issues from a man's point of view.,4
57126,there must be faster way to begin subscription - close to two months to recieve magazine subscription is not desirable to my taste.,1
57145,I ordered the one year subscription (non auto-renewal).  I received four issues and then it stopped.  Okay...it was only eight bucks but this is bogus!,1
57157,"If you read esquire you can't beat the renewal deal. Love this magazine its got it all girls, cars, fashion, stories, food, humor. You name it you got it.",5
57178,"I ordered a subscription before Christmas and I still have not recieved the first issue. I guess I should cancel it? What say you, amazon staff???? Lame!!!",1
57182,"This magazine is either good or bad,no in betweens. Each issue is different. Way to much advertisement. I have been reading Esquire for years. Worth the price for subscription.",4
57201,I just got my first issue and it was a great read from cover to cover. Highly recommended.,5
57212,I was a little disappointed on how long it took for me to recieve my first issue. Now with another magazine that ordered at the same time Ive recieved 3 issues to your one,4
57254,They omit various sections - no real rhyme or reason - just poor quality control,2
57256,I just clicked on the free issue and without my consent Amazon took money for the whole year. There is no way you can desubscibe.,1
57257,Too hard to read on a Kindle.,1
57259,Horrible format,1
57261,Value for money. Very informative lways current and upto date.,4
57262,I cancelled this to Obama like for me,1
57266,too expensive...sorry.,1
57267,I have been billed but don't have the magazine on my Android tablet yet.  they are trying to help me.,1
57268,"Poor articles and news, sorry
It's not just same for Time, also for Newsweek...",1
57270,News I could used.  I just wish I had the time to read it,4
57271,"Nice magazine, of course, but the view i can get through the kindle pprwhite is definitely bad. Not recommended for this kindle.",1
57281,Isn't the same old Time. But still pretty good.,3
57283,"You have got to be Kidding TIME MAGAZINE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
............ get with the program ..
 nope won't be buying the subscription as I planned to ...  .",1
57286,do not suggest buying this for kindle paperwhite no pictures and confusing format.  I barely read it it was horrible.,1
57288,Very difficult to read Time Magazine on Kindle. Very bad choice! I wouldnot recommend it to anyone at all. I regret my choice.,1
57290,"Didn't seem to get wide range of topics in the news, and so will buy another publication to see if there is a difference,",2
57292,It was a bad surprise to me to read Times. I did not find interesting the materials and brought to me nothing new.,2
57296,I compared this to ipad app and the physical magazine. Clumsy app and I found it difficult to navigate through the articles and know where I was.,2
57305,"On my Kindle Paperwhite, Time is not in color and there is not a complete edition of the magazine. I won't be paying for a subscription.",3
57307,"I guess it takes getting used to handling the magazine on the Kindle, but I had some difficulty. Will see if I get better at it with the next issue.",3
57314,"Althought there are not good images articles are good and easy to navigate, i am really considering to subscribe to the magazine",4
57333,"I did not like the fact that it was only for my kindle and not my Kindle for my Android device, being a magazine it would've been nice to see it in a color device",1
57334,Sometimes the squence of quotes is a bit confusing. And at times pictures are described but there is no pictures to view..,4
57348,"come on TIME magazine...i want to subscribe...but i have a kindle fire!  Available on all other types of kindles,,,how come not the fire?",1
57366,And this periodical is thin on content.  A half dozen items and that's it.  Now if I can just figure out how to cancel before the 14 days is up.,2
57371,"Honestly, it would be ALOT better with the pics and graphs. All I have to say is: GET THE NOOK!",1
57376,"The Kindle edition is much more expensive than the print edition....and does not have the charts, pictures etc. Hope TIME is rethinking soon.",2
57380,This is really stupid. I can buy Time for Kindle for $2.99 a issue or subscribe for $1.99 a copy. Who is the idiot who decided that? This world is full of stupid people.,1
57383,"Kindle or news stand edition, it's still a rag suitable only for the aluminum foil brigade or Obamamaniacs. May be useful if have a birdcage to line.",1
57393,dont assume you are purchasing current weeks publication when buying a single issue. theres no way to check cover until its downloaded on your kindle and have paid for it.,1
57397,"No pictures (some present), awkward table of content.  In all, very unpleasant to read in Kindle format.",1
57427,too abbreviated. also no pics or charts. looks like Time did a very minimalist job on this project and made themselves look bad in the process.,1
57437,Best guitar magazine available. Top notch articles and song transcriptions. Worth every peso!,5
57438,Didn't even after complaint  put entire address on label so my son only got 1.thanks for wasting my money,1
57449,Here we go again.  The subscription service is failing to deliver the magazine.  This happened happened before.  Otherwise a good magazine.,1
57452,There's too much emphasis on heavy metal in this magazine. It's boring.,1
57458,My husband loves this magazine.  He can't wait for it to arrive every month.  It is the first thing he reads when a new one comes in the mail.,5
57459,I love the digital subscription. Now I can stay up to date on my musical interest's,5
57468,Good  magazine,3
57476,Too much metal and not enough acoustic articles and products.,3
57505,Bought it in January and still wiating for the first issue....4 months for a magazine? If I suscribe through them I get that months issue in a week.,1
57528,"Get this magazine if you like the latest gaming news, and the latest game demos. Well worth the price I paid for this.",5
57536,I've been reading this for years and it is great. I really like the reviews and the hardware stuff.,5
57544,This would have been a great purchase because of the cost. Just over a month now and I have yet to see an actual issue be delivered.,4
57557,"Don't know what happened or who to call, going on 7 weeks and still no magazine.",1
57582,"I liked reading the articles, but found it difficult to follow the red, blue, and purple lines in the monochrome diagrams.  This would be excellent in a color system.",3
57583,Tired of depressing news all the time?  Then this is for you.  Fresh new ideas and inventions.  I love it.  Something positive about our future.,5
57586,"Nice exploration of current happening in Tech. Much more than Popular Science, but not as deep as Scientific American. I look forward to each issue",4
57595,Is not for Hobbyst,1
57611,Disappointing. Too general.,1
57617,Doesn't seem to have the same (or all of the) articles I see in currents,3
57618,Reading format needs to be considered.,2
57619,So vain...,1
57626,Mit tech review is one of the best glimpses into the future that one can get...excellently researched and written. Awesome!!!,5

57736,i love this magazine.  I especially love all of the recipes in it.  I enjoy it every month.  I highly suggest it,5
57737,Not much content to this magazine. You really have to love tea in order to love this magazine. I like it for the table settings and a few recipes.,3
57765,Best Magazine Ever For Men or Women!!!,5
57770,Love G&G! Already pay for print and not going to double down for e_copy. Too bad they don't seem to offer subscribers free digital copies.,3

57808,Our favorite magazine,5
57823,best magazine I read from cover to cover....a must have for any southern girl:),1
57833,This is one of the best Southern magazines out there. It's a mixture of Oxford American and Southern Living. Not too much fluff and puff pieces. I highly recommend.,5
57885,"This magazine is an excellent sampling of Southern delights, whether it be art, food, music, fashion... they have it covered.",5
58221,I ordered this as a gift and it came to me instead. I contacted the publisher through amazon 3 times and still the problem wasn't solved.,1
58233,"I ordered this magazine 8/3/09.
It is now 9/8/09.
I still have not received one issue of this magazine.
So I think even one star is inappropriate.
by the way,
Where's my magazine?",1
58246,"Ilove
I love this magazine. It has the perfect blend of beauty products and fashion. The luxe for less is fantastic.",5
58255,It wasn't for me.,1
58258,Decent magazine but can be expensive.,3
58259,Always liked this magazine. when I worked in a salon.  Now I have my own.  I just wished they had more older women in it!,4
58266,One of my very favorite magazines! Great deal too!,5
58271,Interactive has to much trouble downloading...this magazine in kindle form just would never show many of the pages.,1
58273,Navigation is glitchy and some content appears to be missing in the current issue.,4
58278,Better for younger women,3
58281,"The magazine gives everything I'm looking for such as blogger style in all shapes and sizes, and street style. The blip app is an added plus.",4
58284,"Well, for some reason I thought I was buying People, not style watch. But I actually enjoyed flipping thru it...so I'll keep it.",4
58293,"I ordered this in early July, I received one issue and nothing since. DONT ORDER",1
58299,I love the fashion.,5
58308,"Well, for some reason I thought I was buying People, not style watch.  But I actually enjoyed flipping thru it...so I'll keep it.",4
58315,"Don't bother, only partially downloads & then stays in a ""waiting to download"" state.",1
58327,Great magazine and great fashions. I like the fact that they also tell you where you can purchase them.,4
58335,I love style watch print so I thought the kindle addition would be been better.. However I'm still waiting for the magazine to download since Friday.. Not happy..,1
58338,"I have been a longtime subscriber and the print version usually takes forever to get to me.
Its nice having the kindle version for that reason!",4
58346,I love this magazine. It's full of fashion tips and not cluttered with ads and articles. Straight forward and can't miss.,5
58364,"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. Unless you are strictly into what people are wearing, you won't find this magazine interesting. Cancelled after receiving 1st issue.",1
58376,I actually love the magazine which is why I ordered but 2 months later......where is it?,1
58383,"I was looking forward to this magazine.  However, it is well past the date I was given for delivery and I still have not received it.",1

58396,Have not received a copy of this yet and I ordered it almost two months ago!,1
58408,I ordered this back in August and I have yet to receive my first issue. I didn't mean to rate this item as (I hate it). I wish I would have gotten it by now.,1
58412,"The magazine itself is great. So far, it's been months and we've only received two. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",3
58414,Grandson not interested in this cute book.,3
58424,Much smaller than I imagined it would be. More of a pamphlet than a magazine. But my kids like the pictures.,2
58433,it is so much smaller than I expected but the kids will like it I hope.,3
58435,"No good. I subscribed to this in October, received one copy, and am now told it is unavailable.",1
58449,High priced for a very thin paper flyer in my opinion.  This is not a bound magazine like a regular National Geographic is so I was a bit disappointed since the price is higher.,2
58459,"Present for grandkids, who love it.",5
58462,My granddaughter loves all of these National Geographic Little Kids books!!  I have them all!!  They are so colorful and informative!!  Love Love Love them!!!,5
58465,"Great magazine. But should be named ""national geographic toddler"". Too simple for my 6 y.o. will be great like for 3-4 y.o.",3
58469,"The magazine was fun, but I only received one issue",3
58485,Would have absolutely loved !!this subscription had I kept getting it....I received 2 and haven't gotten another one!,1
58499,"Small fold out, only a couple pages. Was looking for something a little bigger and solid for my 6 year old. This is like something you get at a restaurant.",3
58531,Smaller than expected and very few pages.,2
58533,My 3-year old grandson LOVED it.  He brought it to pre-school to read to his class at share time. Yeah! Its exactly what a Grammy wanted.,5
58538,Nice layout; easy for little ones to go through. A few more pages would be welcomed.,4
58554,We looked forward to each magazine. But had the whole thing done quickly. They're short.,4
58556,"excellent, grandkids love this!",5
58574,Got this for my niece for Christmas and she really loved getting something new to read in the mail. The only down side was that it took 8 weeks for it to start getting to her.,4
58591,My child asks daily if he has a new magazine in the mail.  This is so awesome for a little nature lover.  Highly recommend.,5
58597,Purchased for grand kids.  They love it !  That makes me happy.,5
58604,Highly recommend for 6 year old and up.,5
58608,Excellent kids magazine.,5
58633,"Just ordered this for my granddaughter she loves animals, reading, books and learning so I know she will love this",5
58634,my grandson and great-grandson both love this magazine.  This was a birthday gift for both of them and they both love it.,5
58660,I would say its too small. It also often gets torn up in the mail and you really don't get very many magazines for the price you pay.,2
58691,"my 4 & 5 yr old granddaughter love this magazine, order subscription for christmas and they are already coming. super fast",5
58711,the nation is probably one of the poorist publications i have read to date.  do not waste your time on this .,1
58717,after the editor of the nation came out for obama and had such negative remarks about clinton on larry king s program.....the nation will no longer be on my kindle.,1
58729,The best there is!,5
58731,"It's just screen shots of the magazine on the fire, not individual articles. I think I'd rather read it on paper....",3
58743,disappointed,2
58753,That says it all.... It's ok.,3
58756,"Still the very BEST, most vital, unbiased and truthful news publication in the United States!",5
58764,"The Nation publishes well-written carefully thought-out articles about subjects one has a
responsibility to know more about. They are committed.",4
58775,excellent reading at a great price. I found it very easy to read on my kindle keyboard device. No advertisements were a bonus,4
58779,"Lenism displaced by about 100 years. What a waste; evidently the final ""soup kitchen"" for academia.

Odd that such ""mentality"" is still around after 1991.",1
58788,"From week to week, number of articles is very inconsistent. This should be an embarassment for a periodical with THE NATION's reputation.",3
58796,"either you're into leftist claptrap, in which case welcome home, or you're not, in which case try Reason Magazine",1
58802,Don't know can't download it. Not available. I would like to give you a review but I can't so 0 is it.,1
58804,"Love the magazine, love the kindle version!",5
58807,I love readers digest I have for years,5
58812,Not too much that really interested me.,3
58816,I enjoy reading the Readers Digest from front to back .,4
58817,Quick read. Varied subjects and informative. Easy read!,4
58820,Not as good as I thought.,3
58828,My all time favorite.  Best articles  good variety.,5
58829,"best magazine out there , read it from cover to cover.",5
58830,"It's OK, but I thought it would include graphics, pictures and the jokes!  Maybe it's been too long since I actually held the magazine in hand?",3
58844,There is always something to learn from reading the variety of articles.,4
58845,"I like that you can skip around articles while reading them.  It has been quite awhile since I read Readers Digest, glad to subscribe again.",3
58848,Would have liked to have seen more Christmas stories.,2
58849,Interesting stories and diversions when your time is limited,4
58850,it won't come up on my Kindle Fire. That's why I purchased it.,1
58875,Very dissappointed Reader's digest isn't available on my Kindle fire. Does anyone have any idea why this id the case?,1
58878,Reader's Digest has always a good magazine with relevant material.  It still is today and the Kindle version is just as good.  Very clean design.,4
58881,"It's nice to get Reader's Digest on my Kindle, but the pictures are too blurry to see. You'd think technology today could do better!",3
58885,I love it!  Just how I remember it from my younger years. Entertaining and informative and heartwarming stories. One of my favorites of all time!,5
58887,Reading this on my paper white Kindle is great. I love the variety of articles in Readers Digest. I look forward to each issue.,5
58891,"ITS FULL OF POSITIVE NEWS.NEVER A DULL ARTICLE.I READ IT FROM COVER TO COVER.I ENJOY ""EVERY DAY LIFE and HUMOR IN UNIFORM.",5
58892,I have enjoyed Reader's Digest for years.  I just recently tried it on my Kindle. I was unhappy with the typos in the Kindle version.,3
58896,"In fact, with a subscription the printed version is cheaper than the pixel version.  Insane.  Also the Kindle version lacks the look of the print version, except for the cover.",1
58906,"articles too short, hard to read on a kindle.  Information very simple I feel like this publication is now out of date with all we have available to us",2
58916,"Not nearly as good a magazine as it used to be. I used to subscribe yearly, but it is no longer worth the money.",2
58925,Just OK.  I kind of like the old fashioned magazine.  Doesn't have enough pictures and not very easy to navigate back and forth.,3
58927,This wasn' the best reader digest that I have read so far there are some that I do like and some I don't.,2
58939,I like the Kindle version better on the Kindle verses the book.  You do not have to deal with all of the advertisements.,3
58941,"......and it feels real on my tablet! I have been a subscriber for years, and this was quite new for me (transition from in-hand to online) but it has been worth the try.",5
58948,"""This title is not available for customers from your location in: Europe""
If I want to pay for your magazine, why not let me do this?",1
58949,Needs a lot more work. Be more like the paper print. I Feel like I am reading a rough draft. Add more POP.,3
58951,I guess that I thought Readers Digest would follow page by page the published magazine and it didn't.  I found it hard to read and understand the format.,1
58957,My only complaint has more to do with Kindle than Reader's Digest. I don't like not being able to bookmark my place.,4
58962,I purchased this only to find out its not available on the kindle fire! Which seems a bit silly as the fire is the latest version of the kindle.,2
58965,"i need to cancel this magazine asap. my problem is i'm on the road with no access to internet. kindle people, please read this!",1
58976,"As a longtime reader of RD, I am upset that I have to pay for a digital subscription as well. This app should give me digital editions for free with an account number or password.",2
58981,"It is January 2 and the December issue that I read back in November is the only current issue, although I am a monthly subscriber.",1
58989,Why is a hard copy subscription $10/year and the e version 1.50/month.  Seems backwards to me. Shouldn't the e version be less expensive.  No mailing etc.,1
59012,"Last issue in Nov 2010. Nothing in Dec, nothing (yet) in Jan 2011. This is not a monthly magazine, so why pay for it??? I cancel today",1
59014,"I do like the no add thing, but I find it a little cumbersome to navigate and find individual articles. If I can figure out how to cancel my trial subscription I will.",2

59131,My elderly father loves this. This is an excellent magazine for the amateur sky watcher. Enough science to keep the mind stimulated and wonderful exciting photos of our universe.,5
59136,Ordered for my son.  He loves astronomy and reads every issue.,5
59145,"I love this magazine, it's a must have in my opinion. It has wonderful pictures and I love reading the articles.",5
59147,I'm reading it on my kindle and it's difficult to get to different sections. That's my only complaint on the magazine,3
59148,Good magazine but one draw back is that it is only available on my android phone should be able to see it in amazon cloud.,4
59151,This was a gift for my dad..  It's his favorite magazine.  He has to read it from cover to cover.,5
59177,"I renewed a subscription for someone on your ""renew site"" and now the magazine comes to me instead of the gift recipient.  Not good.",3

59374,"The information was excellent and well presented. However, the question answer format can get a bit tedious.",4
59377,A few good articles on finding a job. Almost nothing really all that helpful in the money Dept. Seemed like a lot of whining about things that aren't silver plattered.,2
59380,"Warning. Downloading from this site, and reading the material will cause your Kindle to become inoperable, or, at least in my case--more than once.",1
59402,Not really that much information for a magazine.,3

59538,Husband doesn't like it so much. Too much news.,4

59896,Good information I just wish there was some more male oriented content. Overall very good magazine. Love the colorful pictures.,4

59911,Lots of great ideas. Helps with reco orating any room. Simple and not so expensive ideas too. Love the color pallets,4

62559,"I like the articles in the magazine but there just aren't that many... Quite a lot of advertising, as is to be expected, I'm sure.",3
62567,not what I expected to many advertizements,1
62572,Love this magazine! Great tips and lots of gear showcased and great tips and exercises to practice.,5
62573,"I love this magazine and having it on line is so helpful, without waiting for the mail and having it anywhere. It's great.",5
62586,"No real articles, as others have posted, it's mostly advertisements.  I won't be renewing Yoga Magazine.  I got it for Mother's Day, and Mother isn't impressed.",1
62590,"Great value.  New practices, fantastic and well written articles that help me live my life mindfully. Learn more about your practice.",5
62595,"It's all ads. There is barely anything to actually read :(. This is all about marketing not education and growth.
Disappointing",1
62596,Love Yoga Journal and love that I can have it auto-renewed through Amazon and I never miss a magazine.  Great product and great service.,5
62599,"Some tips, a useful article here and there, but then, do you really need it?  Just a bit less tree in the world, and how is that very zen?",3
62602,Inspirational photos and articles. I want to get back into yoga and the instructional content is motivating. Plus the yoga fashions are great too.,4
62614,I didn't sign up for automatic renewal. I don't like it.please remove me from this.mmmmm bbbb and the next ok,1
62630,"Changing formats is challenging and they succeed--just barely.  I had to enlarge every page to read them. Of course, there are too many ads, but that is just SOP",3

62649,"Informative articles aimed at the beginner. Ads, ads and more ads but they pay the bills. Worth subscribing to. Very Australian orientated.",4
62651,I like the pics and the information provided. I would recommend the magazine. I especially liked the different ways it could be viewed on my kindle fire.,4
62665,Good value for this magazine and saves me money. I don't have to shop for it in the grocery store or at the mall.,4
62667,"Yoga poses, sequences, food advice, meditation advice, references for music, books, retreats, etc. I LOVE the journal and will be a subscriber for life.",5
62671,You gotta reallllly be into yoga and looking for seminars and weekends away - the magazine was useless except for 2 or 3 articles.  All advertisements.  I'm not renewing.,2
62672,It was a good test subscription for the promotional price. The magazine contains a lot of advertisements. I wish it contains more and newer articles.,3
62677,I like this magazine a lot. As a student of yoga this is interesting to learn of other schools of thought and practice.,4
62686,Would have been 5 stars but there are too many ads.  Otherwise i enjoy it and it has plenty to offer for some food for thought.,4
62688,This mag is over my yoga-ability and way more serious about the true yoga spiritualism than I am comfortable with.,2
62690,I would prefer not to have the auto-renewal feature.  It would be nicer to have the option or a reminder of renewal.,3
62692,I do Hot Yoga. I thought some things might be the same or interesting. It is very different  it is great if you do regular yoga.,3

looked at it myself but I believe it must be good because these kids have
everything!",3

I would not read it again",2
62879,It's a great magazine with lots of information . Articles are well full of great facts and  It's an informative,5
62887,It's not like a real magazine. Pages are black and even with few illustrations. They need to make it look like a real magazine like Google play does.,2
62905,Needs more text. This is a bit too much like Popular Science...but without the pictures. Otherwise pretty good. Worth a look.,3
62907,"I was expecting a format with more images to be seen in a kindle format, it is like a regular book.",3
62908,The articles themselves could be a little longer and contain a little more information to explain the topic more fully,3
62912,it was easy to download and read. The content was good. The variety of subjects was what i expected. thanks,3
62917,"A good science mag, but not really break through. I like popular science better. And popular mechanics better too. .",3
62923,Kindle format made it difficult to navigate and the articles were dry... it can be challenging to bring life to heavy scientific topics,2
62925,"I really enjoy reading every edition, I look forward to it. Every time I read it I learn something new and think about the world around me.",4
62963,Quality Magazine with lots of good ideas. Wish it had more easy to sew ideas or old clothes modification design ideas.,3

62986,"I would give this zero stars if I could. Horrible customer service. With other quality options, it's just not worth the money or hassle.",1
63000,This version of Barrons didn't work well in the kindle. The printed version just doesn't work the same on the kindle,2
63016,Would love to subscribe once the online edition has a more reasonable price. Right now I am paying $52 for 1 year and to buy this subscription does not make sense.,1
