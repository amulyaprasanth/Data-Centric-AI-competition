I have subscribed to the nook version for a few years now and thoroughly enjoy this magazine. It has enough tech and what's new to keep me happy.,4
This magazine is just ok. I ended up subscribing to pc world instead. They are more for the technician and not just the cusumer.,3
I have been a Maximum PC reader since its beginning and still read it cover to cover. Awesome magazine. Love it,5
"There articles are alright, but they screw you on the amount you get as i only got 10 of the 12 months subcription. so be carefull unless you are on the auto renew.",3
Excellent product! I love reading through the magazine and learning about the cool new products out there and the cool programs!,5
"I like Maximum PC magazine, but when I received my first copy it came without the CD. I will not renew my subsciption.",3
First time ordering this magazine.  It was a little more upscale then I am.  It did not cover much that I am interested.,3
Nothing to it.  Just an advertisement.  Little article content.,1
I've only gotten one so far I don't know why,1
they changed the magazine and it's just trash. i canceled my subscription.,1
sucks (period),1
it is great read and great ideas for today's men .. great price.. buy it today.. go for it :),5
Really affordable subscription compared to GQ and other magazines. I also like the fact that they show clothing form different price ranges and not just high end like GQ does.,4
Very dissapointed. I love this magazine and was very dissapointed to find out the cd's were not included with the subscription.,3
"waste of my money and worse, waste of my time.....",1
This magazine has become so boring! Disappointed in the content and reviews.,1
Allure sent me 3 magazines in the space of a month in order to get rid of back issues. Very disappointed.,1
Doesn't support my Kindle paperwhite,1
"I'm a female, but I like this magazine just to see how guys are haha.
Layout, design, and articles are enjoyable.
and good price for a year round subscription.",4
This magazine doesn't really have much to it. I'm glad I got the subscription for free!,3
I was subscribed to the magazine for many years and USED to love it.  I hate this kindle edition.  All ads.  Cannot find a place to unsubscribe.  Help !,1
A must for all bottom-dwellers,5
Does not work on Kindle for WP.,1
"A+++ I bought this for my son-in-law a few years ago, and renew it every year as an ongoing Christmas gift. He loves it!!!",5
"I'm sure someone else would love this magazine, it just wasn't for me.",2
"this mag has gone downhill in my estimation since they got rid of the former editor Linda Wells after 20 years or so. too bad, it was so great before. cancelling my subscription.",2
Great magazine with lots of new beauty products to learn about.,4
Lot of advertisements,3
"We ordered it in December, its now the end of February, the 10 weeks are up.  Where is the magazine?",1
Packed with so much information.  I look forward to getting it each time.,5
I found it boring.,2
"I have a print subscription, and I'm excited to have this on my Kindle as well.",4
interesting magazine for DYI'ers...,4
Great price. Love it.,5
Where did my magazines go? I only received one issue since last year!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"I really like this magazine with its in depth insight into the PC and related software. If you like PC info, software, some hardware hacks and more you'll like this magizine.",4
Even though I tried to download the magazine it would not . Now I have this with no way to get it.,1
Want to canceled Now... Thank you.,1
Do not like,1
Can't give a review on Maximum PC.  Never received the magazine.  Instead I was sent the men's magazine FHM.  Please send my Maximum PC.,1
Love this magazine! Never disappoints!,5
Always filled with tons of free samples and interesting information. Love this magazine.,5
Every issue I learn something new and I've been doing woodwork for many years.,5
"Love this magazine. As a female, can't live without it. Filled with awesome tips and tricks, build plans, and inspiring ideas",5
"Love it, my favorite!",5
All ads and not impressed at all with photos or articles. Cancelled the subscription right away. Not worth the money.,1
Love this magazine. If you are a DIY person then for the price worth buying.,5
1 article and 15 advertisements.,2
Okay.  I wasn't impressed with my first issue so I'll see if I will renew this one.  Not quite what I was looking for.,3
I just love this magazine! Ive gotten it for a few years. I try to never let my subscription lapse. Great price on amazon too!!,5
"Order this and a subscription to Computer Shopper on Dec 28 2001, got my Computer Shopper in Jan 2002, still have not seen a issue of Maximum PC as of end of Arril.",1
This is a magazine made of clowns! Bozo rules! I friendly advice to people is to get almost any other magazine. This one is completely lost.,1
"Do not buy. You get a 4 or 5 issues, then they stop. Contacted Amazon, got 1 more issue then they stopped again. A rip off. We need a NO star option.",1
Love the magazine. It has great ideas and tips. It is very helpful and knowledgeable on so many different projects. Thank you Handyman.,5
Best mag out there,5
I love Allure,5
magazines may have gone digital but that makes their ads even more annoying--it takes way too long to get to the stories and by then I don't want to read it.,1
Love the mag but it doesn't work on my Kindle due to there update and they haven't fixed the problem !!!! They just give you the run around!!,1
I like it and extended my subscription,4
"Like content , but way to much advertisements.",3
Love this magazine!!! It has the best beauty tips and I love the articles too :) Also love that I can read it on my Kindle Fire HD. Two thumbs up!,5
"This is the only magazine I subscribe to. Great articles, great fashion and make up tips. It's fantastic tat I can view it on my kindle.",5
"Order it in March and only receive 2 copy so far, will never order any magazine every again.",1
Always alot of practical articles for around the house. Sometimes has to many ads but overall pretty good articles,4
"I love this magazine! I subscribe to approx 10 to 15 magazines and I look forward to this one most! Great tips, money savers, and fashion insight in general!",5
It has only a few good articles (2 or 3) and the rest are just ads.  Simply put too many ads.,3
I love this magazine...,5
"As such, I am unable to review it.

However, I can review the ship time and I am not pleased with it at all.",1
One of the most beneficial magazines I have seen.  Every issue has plenty of helpful tips and hints and the projects are within the abilities of the average person.,5
Faulty DRM would not allow me to view the magazine on my Fire HD. Was forced by the app to remove the magazine.  Seriously annoyed.,1
Decent articles but the adds have gotten out of hand.,3
Lots of good tips and easy projects for beginning diy-ers.,4
It took two months to receive the first magazine and didn't receive any more after that.  Defenitely the last magazine subscription I order from Amazon.,1
"I used to love this magazine because it was fun and fashion. Now, it's gotten all political and ""edgy."" Blah.",1
Great content! Happy reading with this magazine! Also a good tool for learning English. Love it!,5
"This is a great magazine. I have subscribed to it for as long as I can remember. It is full of great advice, new product information, etc. I love it and HIGHLY recommend it!!",5
"When the renewal starts since I purchase it.
The letter came yesterday to renewal it so now do it.",3
This magazine is a waste of money and bores me.  Nothing here to see but ads.,1
"Meh, I'll just pick it up at the store.",3
This goes well with my print subscription.,4
"Truly enjoyed this issue and the enclosed projects. The information was current and the patterns very well written. Packed full of ideas, concepts and educational articles.",5
"I ended up cancelling, because it became too political. I wanted more fashion!",2
"sucks
you may or may not receive you order",1
gift for son and he loves it!,5
Waste of money never down loaded on my fire,1
I love this!,5
"Have to say very disappointed, poor articles and a lot of unrealistic ideas.",2
"If you love to tinker, build and repair you'll love Handyman.",5
"Good info, just not very easy projects..",4
"Did not order this, I hate magazines.",1
Like most mags today too many adds,3
too many add.s,3
This is a great magazine for fun reading.,5
"Great, Awesome, Amazing!!!",5
Access to my  favorite magazine has never been this easy.  Love the interactive pages and the bookmark feature.,5
"Good solid magmazine.  AS usual, I wish there were less ads",4
This magazine is about 70% advertisements.  It's a shame.  I canceled my subscription.,1
I just re-ordered this magazine. It can be repetitive like any fitness mag but it keeps me motivated to hit the gym and that's all I care about.,3
It covers many areas and has an updated wealth of information.,4
Good stuff on fitness and eating healthy. Too much crap about sex and how to either do it better or get more of it. Should just stick to fitness/well-being.,3
Once upon a time this was a great magazine. That was years ago. Now it is full of ads and recycled articles. They haven't had anything new or worth reading in a long time.,1
I got carpel tunnel syndrome just trting to get through the ads. Not happy.,1
I love what part of the magazine that was downloaded. It really upsets me when I can't read the entire article because not all was downloaded. What can be done?,2
"This app needs work as it will only download the first few pages then ""gets stuck"".  Glad I only bought one issue and I will delete that.",1
"Do not download, Did not download all the way for me and still was charged very disappointed will not download again",1
"Rubbish
Full of ads",1
Got it for my son but he had to cancel it because there were too many risqu&eacute; articles and pictures in it (he has 3 small boys),3
Too many adds!,3
"A great mix of general nutrition , lifestyle , and exercise articles .",4
Won't buy again. Too many advertisements.,1
I get this magazine and comments are Right..Nothing but ads! If I wanted to see ads I would just watch TV!,1
"I love this magazine, a little of everything; decorating, recipes, and lots of outdoor garden ideas.
It's an incredible value!",5
"not like use to.  Too much ads, (every page?)  no thanks",1
Thought this was a monthly magazine. Buyer receivies one mag every 3 months. Every three months one can almost forget they ordered the magazine.,1
"Many new ideas, informative....",4
Did not find it worthwhile,1
"a great magazine even for an ""old timer""",5
So sad that a historical magazine has declined,1
Lots of adds.  Light on content.,3
The ratio of advertisement to content was unappealing.,2
Very thin and the photos aren't great.,2
85% of each issue is ads. I have a subscription to it so I just put it in the recycle bin each time I get it. Pretty disappointing the lack of content!,1
Always loved this magazine.  The articles are great and the clothes are so beautiful! Thank you for reminding me I'm a woman!,5
I am very displeased with this.  I tried to cancel my subscription but they would not do so.  I do not want this magazine.,1
I have not received the magazine yet!! It was paid on September. 14th!!! Not happy!! It is now October 18th!!!!,1
Paid for a year and only received 2 magazines in 6 months!,1
This only came for two months and then just stopped... not a very good mag anyway,1
Not available  for purchase? Why list it under Kindle Unlimited  then?,1
"I'm sure it's a pretty good mag, but I'll never know, because it will not download to either my Kindle or my PC.",3
Good luck reading this on a smart phone or kindle. The text is so small you'll spend half your rine pinching the screen and the other half cursing.,1
Not compatible on Android tablets via Kindle app.  Beware...,1
Received an issue around thanksgiving and then nothing.,1
Too many ads,2
Haven't Bought Magazines In A Long Time. Decided to try. Most Of The Magazine Are Adds.,3
Almost half the magazine is alcohol and cigarette ads.  Could not use them to reading time in my classroom.,2
"Garbage for gullible people.  Self esteem will result from positive relationships and service to others, not physique.  This drivel will only damage your health, not improve it.",1
Articles are no longer very interesting.  Basically you can get all the highlights of the articles online for free.,1
"The magazine is ok ,but what I want to know is if I can get the kindle version only without the printed magazine?
Thank you!",3
Very disappointing as every turn of the page there is full page advertisements. Hardly any articles and not impressed with them.,1
"my mother kept every Christmas issue for years
I love looking at them . . classic",5
"Excellent magazine, wonderful and informative.",5
I bought this for my kids but quickly cancelled after seeing all the tobacco ads.,1
Its okay.  I am used to the older style of Popular Science magazines.  Just something missing.,3
Got 1 or 2 issues! Waste of money,1
Great magazine and love Jimmy the Bartender...,5
This subscription seems to come intermittently. The magazine is mostly advertisements. We won't renew.,2
A little too homey for me. I only cook for one and this is more for a family person.,3
"I like most of the decorating articles, real people doing real things to their homes.  The rest of the magazine is okay.",3
"Good magazine, plenty of interesting stuff, up to date info, fashions, fashion tips, health and beauty.
Would recommend.",4
It is a great magazine for men.,5
Love this magazine! Lots of great ideas and tips. Also really enjoy the recipes,5
One of the best magazine out there,5

Outstanding magazine.,5
"The monthly magazine as well as the emails I get every day have greatly helped my workout routine, my diet, and my wardrobe! It's really cheap too! I highly recommend!",5
Magazine is nothing but advertisements,1
Have always lived Better Homes. Always good recipes and decorating ideas. Love it through the holidays,5
This is definitely a magazine worth buying! So much helpful information!!,5
Still am waiting on the magazine when I got an email a month ago saying it was being processed and I should get it shortly,1
"In a world full of teen magazines, I am thankful to have a grown-up outlet for pleasurable reading.",4
"Aah, I like science but. Magazines are mostly advertisement. NOT ENOUGH SCIENCE.",3
"I decided to test out the magazine with 4 issues for .99, then get charged. I only got 2 and it tried to charge me. No way.",1
Love it! The price was excellent.,5
Good read !,4
Expect 95% ads 5% actual content.,1
Love the magazine.  Love the price!!!,5
It has a lot of adds,3
SO many ads now... I'm glad I didn't pay full price. Im 28 and viagra ads every other page aren' necessary.,3
"Of all the magazines I get, this is by far my favorite.",5
I subscribed to a magazine that is mostly advertisements.  Little information compared to ads for other products.,1
"It's a good magazine, but nothing spectacular about it. But then I just read a single issue of the magazine from my subscription.",3
"Magazine is primarily advertisements  Very, very little content regarding gardening and home",2
The Best!,5

"Quality of this publication has gone down over the past years. Pretty dissapointed in the content, will not renew my subscription",3
I don't like this one so cancelled my subscription.,1
I bought this for my husband and paid $15 for two years. We have gotten 1 issue in 3 months and 5 bills saying we owe $10. This is an awful deal.,1
Love my magazine every month,5
Charged twice so cancelled. Refunded only the one charge. Lesson Learned.,1
Good magazine but some better diet plans or meal planning with more recipes would make it a great monthly read,4
"Same as I remember. Great for younger guys, but as you get older, it just seems more and more useless.",3
The magazine has seemed to take a slightly homosexual slant. I will not purchase it again because i don't think it represents who i am as a man anymore.,1
It is a okay just wished it had more interesting content.,3
"Only received one issue.  Great magazine, bad deal.",1
"light reading, not terribly informative or technical",3
Tried to cancel the auto subscription but was unable too!!!!! Suggest buying from another source.,1
I purchased a digital and print subscription and my kindle had only received one copy of men's health.,1
Just don't like the format on my tablet,1
very satisfied.,4
Magazine target demographic is shortsighted and too tight to satisfy larger available audience.  Sadly disappointing.  Should & could be so much better.,2
I am a senior lady serial home remodeler and try to be as hands on as my tired arthritic old body allows. This has long been one of my favorite magazines. Love it,5
Wonderful & fun to read.,5
Nothing but ads,1
Never ordered this mag???,1
My favorite at a great price. Been getting for years.,5
More adds than articles.  Handyman or expert? Most projects are far beyond most homeowners capabilities and tools at the house,2
Boring. Mostly goofy ads,1
Last issue warning after six months. Not renewing.,1
I ordered this for my son but he has yet to receive it!,1
Disappointed,2
Constantly has to re download. Basically unreadable.,1

always good articles.,4
"I like this magazine, but after a year subscription, it pretty much rehashes the same stuff as last year.",3
"The magazine is starting to have fair to much advertising and less pertinent info on ""Men's Health"".  I might have to switch to something else.",3
"i ordered  men's health for someone incarcerated,  i year subscribtion., out of  that year they only received 2 magazines.",1
"I cannot read this magazine with all of the ads. Every other page is an ad. You get half of the magazine, maybe. Some pages have ads on both sides. Go for HGTV Magazine instead.",1
do not want,1
"Too many medical prescription ads for the aging adult, otherwise it's pretty good. 4 stars for the ads.",4
"If you're a man, no other magazine out there compares. A wonderful price, a wonderful gift for those men in your life!",5

I love this magazine because it always has so many useful tips.,5
"I'm writing a one point review because I never did get the magazine on my kindle.  Wow I thought I subscribed to it a while ago.  Please correct.
Diane Boyle",1
Magazine is great. Lots of useful tips. Bad side is that it has too many sponsored articles and advertisements but that's the business.,4
"nothing of much interest, mostly ads",2
great recipes.,4
Love my BHG.,5
It seems to be me a little more liberal than I like. I don't know if I will renew again.,3
"Ridiculous. Show a few recipes and a couple pictures of $25,000 kitchens and you've got this magazine. The rest is nothing but ads for depression and erectile dysfunction.",1
"SOOOO MANY ADS!!!!!
So many in fact, you won't be able to tell what's written by the Magazine and what's an ad.",2
Renewal w/o notice.,1
Not much science; should up the targeted education level.,2
Informative magazine however there are too many advertisements. The price is pretty reasonable. I would recommend this magazine to others.,4
Received my first magazine in May and it was the April issue.  I hope they don't charge me for a month old magazine.,3
Great magazine but with no Kindle app (not Kindle) support not able to read on an Android tablet or smartphone.,3
I.love this magazine.  Do.much great info!,5
"Magazine is a standard in the genre. Often times more expensive ideas than my budget can handle, so I have to look for DIY replacements, but the ideas themselves are nice.",4
Not sure if I will reorder,3
"Definite room for improvement... they are still sending my magazines to my parent's house, after repeated phone calls and account updates.",1
Don't waste your time unless you have a kindle fire or ipad.  Kindle apps on android phones or tablets are not allowed to load this kindle item.,1
Great outdoor articles! We are using many ideas from Better Homes for our backyard and front porch.,4
The magazine is mostly ads. Not worth paying to read ads.,1
I've loved this magazine since I started swiping copies from the school library. I was in 3rd grade.,5
Bought it for my Nana. She loves it,5
"Renewing this magazine is a mistake, as all the info is recycled over time.  Nothing really new after you've received it for a year.",2
You keep sending it to the wrong address and it is present to some else.  I am trying to correct this.,1
My dad loved his birthday present! Thank you!,5
Not the popular science I remembered from from 40 years ago. Just a collection of news articles that you can easily get from online news.,2
"This is perhaps one of the best around the house mags to give you great ideas for home improvement, maintenance and shop organization.",5
Interesting reading. Great recipes!,4
"This is a fine magazine; however, I probably won't renew--don't have the time to read it.",3
"I have been a BHG reader for years.  I love the decorating ideas, gardening tips and great recipes, and now I love the great price!",5
To much advertisement print is yought to read and subject matter is juvenille I will not be ordering next time,2
"I used to read this magazine year's ago, upon receiving my first issue..I could see it had changed somewhat. But I still enjoy reading it.",4
Fun projects with good plans. Interesting articles.,4
Too much advertising! I'm tired of getting more and more ads each month. I've been a subscriber for years but I will cancel due to this issue.,2
I love this magazine and you can't beat this price.,5
every body know Better Homes is a great magazine. I love it for its gardening ideas and very helpful for where to put flowers and plants.,5
Better than most other similar magazines. Easy reading. Perhaps a bit simplistic for experienced handymen who already know many of the tips offered.,4
Received my first two issues on the same day. One i had already purchased a month earlier and the other was the prior months issue! I won't buy subscriptions from here anymore.,1
"As all ways, the best writing/graphic from the thought leaders of the world",5
excellent magazine,5
I bought this as a gift tinny boyfriend and he loves this!,5
"Poor writing, and includes a ridiculous full-page ad for male sexual enhancements.  Don't give this to kids.",1
"love this magazine, lots of everything for everyone...I have read it from cover to cover several times and lots of ideas that I will use.",5
Poor articles and tons of ads. I cancelled my subscription.,1
Too long for the subscription to begib,2
"My favorite magazine, by far.",5
If you are interested in home improvement or home projects you have to have this magazine. I have subscribed for years and always will. Always something new and different.,5
"Useless, more political than scientific, WAY to many ads.  Don't subscribe.",1
"Another THIN issue.  Hoping this was a one-time thing.  Will not purchase again, if this continues to be the norm.",2
A great Christmas gift that keeps on giving all year....,5
Best ever!,5
"I got bombarded with glossy junk mail and watch out for hidden renewals.
My wife got me a subscription through her airline miles program. I did not like it.",1
Disappointed to learn that I can view my print subscription online. I've done enough with BGH.,1
"All the info a man could possibly need to know on virtually every topic squeezed into one mag, awesome!!",5
"I am dissapointed at the fact that I only got one magazine. I am gonna try again.
I wonder what happened to my money",1
Love to read the articles and recipes!  Loved to read mom's subscription growing up and now I've given it to my daughters.  Three generations of readers....,5
Love to have it on my tablet!,5
Terrible. Will not fully download. Worked fine until recently. Last two issues only download a few random pages.,1
I bought this for my boyfriend because he kept taking my Cosmo magazine.  It has great articles for guys and for their girlfriends.,4
The magazine covers an overall spectrum in order to touch on areas of interest for all individuals,4
I haven't recieved a single copy so I can't really review it. All I can say is the amazom service is terrible.,1
"Unfortunately, I must give this magazine a O as I have yet to recieve an issue.",1
wanted decor not recipes,1
Little value in this but didn't expect it.  Just got it for a reception room and it served its purpose,3
"unlike my other magazine subscriptions, I'm unable to expand the page, unable to read it, plan to cancel.",1
I love that I see so much of my style and personality in BHG!,5
Very bad. You don't get to read the magazine because it keeps downloading for ages. Another way of extorting money from innocent subscribers.,1
.my whole family is enjoying this magazine and what a great price,5
"Just started getting this... part of a promotion to use points for a subscription.  So far, so good.  Nothing overwhelmingly special yet.",3
Got this for my wife. She loves it. So many good articles and great recipes.,5
"I cannot get the digital version to download and I wound up being charged for it twice, I use to get it free with my subscription to the paper mag, what gives???",1
I got some really good recipes from that magazine.,4
i cant wait for each issue to arrive I love this magazine has tons of diy projects and tips,5
Boring ! There isn't any information in here that is valuable and will pertain to improving the beauty of your home inside or outside.,1
Stick to the print version.  The digital version is disappointing.,1
"love the magazine!  So does my husband, daughter and her hubby.",5
I got two issues in 1.5 years and they said its up for renwal. Do not buy,1
Have been getting it for years....Love it !!!,5
cant go wrong,4
"OK but too ""what if"" and science ""fiction"" compared to ""Popular Mechanics"" which we also enjoy.",3
"This was a birthday gift for my sister, she's 70 and loves all the ideas which she does herself.",4
"I know it says ""large file, may take longer to download"" but really - it's been three days and its still downloading!",1
"I purchased this to read in doctors office.  With changes in the way it is down loaded and how many can be on my device, that plan is not working.  I do not like",2
My husband loves this magazine. Perfect present for the handyman in him.,5
Again...not like it was 30-40 years ago!,3
"More of an advertising magazine. Ads, ads, and inserted card ads.  Very little content.",2
my favorite wood magazine,5
"The best of the intellectual and, why not, the absurd. Entertaining, thought-provoking. Worth every dime.",5
Love this new version of magazines. Very easy to flip from one topic to another and save a tree in the process and space in my house.,5
I'm not getting these monthly as I had expected.,2
Son Loves this magazine.  He can't wait to receive each issue.  Compelling stories.,5
"I probably shouldn't have gotten it for 5th graders.  There were cigarette ads throughout each issue!  Really could've done without those, and the conversations that followed!",2
"Most of our family on our account has the original Kindle Fire, which this isn't compatible with. Really stupid. Will not renew because only one of us can read it.",1
The new Better Homes App on the Kindle is a pain.  The downloading is slow and incomplete.  The old process was much faster.,1
"A real value for your money. Interactive and fun to read!! Highly recommended for new and fresh ideas for your home and easy, creative recipes.",5
"Wonderful magazine, I am a subscriber for15 years and I love it, now that I can get the digital issue on my kindle, I can read anywhere.
thanks!",5
"The magazine is on the device but to open it, I wait for page downloads that sometimes never happen. Other publications work fine",1
"One of my favorite magazines. Great cooking, decorating & gardening inspiration. Great photos and beautiful colors. It never gets old.",5
I received only two issues and have not been able to download the next issue. I do not seem to have any avenues to resolve my subscription issues.,1
"I have read BH&G since the 70s.  I have never been disappointed with the quality and content.  Always interesting and so full of projects, ideas and recipes.",5
This is a great issue. Loads of creative ideas.  I really like the kindle version.  My BHG can go with me anywhere and always look fresh - unlike the paper magazine!,5
Great for anyone that what do DIY.,4
My dad loves it!,5
I am unable to access the magazine. I'm being asked to sign in with information I don't have. App not working for me at all.,1
I can't give a true review since I haven't read them. But the pictures are great and my husband was truly thrilled to receive the subscription.,4
Never got the digital version,1
"Love reading the great articles, always so interesting.",5
Still don't like the format.,1
I love science and this magazine keeps me up to date on what's happening now and hopefully in years to come.,5
Canx my subscription....way too much advertisement!  Keep in mind though. I hate commercials!  Only exception is Superbowl!,1
started out great then they quit coming. Maybe they're out of business.,3
"I have been reading The Week, Economist and until last year, Newsweek. I wanted to give Mother Jones a try and I wasn't disappointed. Lots of good journalism.",4
"Very honest reporting and as such can be a downer for some, while others may find it invigorating and inspirational.",4
It took forever to get 1 issue! will never order again!,1
Cancelled. Did not have type of content and interest I recalled from long-term subscription from years ago.,1
Good articles but print too small for people who are visually challenged.,3
Can't say it met expectations even though it has been paid for in April but will not receive my first copy until July.  Not the best way to handle subscripons.,1
"I love this magazine. Lots of ride articles, reviews, and tips. I would say it is geared toward the adventure/touring rider. I read every issue from cover to cover.",5
"My Husband is really enjoying this magazine, and I love finding projects in it for him to do for me. Thanks",5
Two and a half months waiting for first magazine...No customer service access to find out why...they where quick to take my money though!!!,1
Always the best Information!,5
Poorly thought out rag,1
"Best bike magazine ever, love it. Great articles on riding safety too. Ron L",5
Kelly-K of Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz says its a magazine for folks like myself who love to ride! [...] check it out!,5
"Been a subscriber to Family Handyman for the last 3 years. I decide to just go digital,  A lot of great I have got from this magazine.",5
I have been getting this magazine for years. Great information and design ideas.,5
"You know it. I love it. Value for the money with lots of tips for home, yard, food, and decorating.",5
The magazine CAN'T be read on a Kindle! I bought it and the publisher decided to NOT make it available for the Kindle...,1
It's full of ads (as are most magazines these days) but there are still some worthwhile articles. I love looking through and thinking about new ways to decorate my own home.,4
I'm very please with my subscription.  Every issue is on time and filled with all kinds of ideas!  Thank you!,5
"Some really good stuff, but mostly it feels like product advertising.",3
Great buy! Highly recommend.,5
We both love this magazine,5
Seems like each magazine gets smaller each time and it appears that there are way too many advertisements.  I liked it much better before.,3
I have always loved Better Homes  and Gardens.  It has always been helpful and timely.  A complete asset to your reading material.,5
"Loved this magazine in the beginning but then noticed some things can be a bit repetitive. Good for coffee tables, but for constant ideas, stick to the internet.",3
Great value.  Magazine arrives promptly and is used in my office waiting room.  A great magazine for women of any age,4
"I ordered 12/16/09, as if 02/12/10 (8 weeks) I haven't received the first issue.  It's taking too long.",1
I'm a HD rider and this is really not defined to that manufactor.  I skim though it every month but I won't subscribe again.,2
"Looks good on the covers, but projects are quite unrealistic and every issue is absolutely full of ads.",2
We are fans of science! It doesn't have as many articles as it used to have 10 years back but we still enjoy it.,4
really neat magazine when the central article is something that interests me,4
If you believe in global warming and other liberal views---this magazine is for you.,1
My dad loves this magazine as he was an electrician and loves all things science!,5
Husband loves it.,5
Please avoid Reason.  The good work they do is negated by their betrayals and attacks on others in the Liberty movement.  Reason needs to fire their senior editors.,1
Great magazine at an amazing price!,5
"The perfect magazine for any science lover.
Every issue is great.",5
A great women's magazine.  So many interesting articles. Can't wait to receive it each month. I love the garden articles.,5
Love this magazine!  Have subscribed to it for years!  Buying my subscription through Amazon gets me the beat price and best delivery!,5
"so many mags are reduced in price, my mom likes this one and we got it for her for mother's day.  we hope she likes it, it is a good read.",4
Cannot live without Texas Monthly!,5
Too many ads.  I feel like this is nothing but a magazine for marketing.  Seems like over half the pages were ads for realtors or doctors.  Rich wanting to be richer.  Nice!,2
Great mag for anyone,5
"My husband loves, loves, loves this magazine. Actually, I find myself flipping through it as well.  If you are a "" do it yourselfer""  than this magazine is a must!",5
disclaimer - I am not much of a handyman but I like this magazine.  Lots of nice tips and articles.,4
Great magazine priced a lot lower than newstand,4
"good prodjects and advice, and good read. a little lite on good stuff and very very add heavy probley will NOT renew i do not like adds with stuff i pay for!!!",3
"Good magazine, it gives you lots of tips and ideas.",4
What can I say?  I love this magazine.  Full of lots of information for any handyman ... you do not have to be an expert.,5
"The price was a good value, however, it takes forever for the first issue to come. So if you order for a gift be sure and let the recipient know about the wait.",4
"As a Texas expat living in NY, I look forward to the arrival every month!  I especially love the indepth articles written by Skip Hollingsworth.",5
"They haven't found a conservative they like yet
But if you skip those articles not a bad read",3
Great magazine but WAY too many ads.,3
I give this magazine to the woodworkers in our family and they love it.  It is well illustrated and has projects for the beginner as well as the advanced woodworker.,5
My favorite self help magazine; and it was cheaper to order from Amazon.,5
Love the subscription,5
"Great magazine for technology and science.  Has some silly stuff, but well worth $5. a year.",4
The print is to small for my poor eyes.,2
"Magazine arrived on time, intact, and just in time. Thank-you.
She enjoys, BH&G, in the print form, as well as on her Kindle.",4
"If you are a do-it-yourselfer YOU REALLY NEED THIS!!!

Great magazine...love the tips and tricks.",5
too much advertisement..but they do put good information an tips,3
Dishonest!,1
"I have been a subscriber for over 20 years and love, love, love this magazine.  Can't beat the value by ordering from here!",5
I love  this magazine!,5
"Enjoy getting the magazine, but rarely have time to read it!",4
"This is truly one of the best written, most interesting magazines available. While its appeal is mainly to Texans or former Texans, others will find the articles interesting.",5
Love the wonderfully written articles and the fantastic focus on our wonderful state. We 'kids' renew it annually as a gift for Daddy!,5
It's a nice resource to stay 'plugged in' to my surroundings. It's a bit heavy on the advertisements though.,4
"As always, this magazine exceeds my exectations.  I learn valuable new tips with every issue.
Sharon Weeks",5
"Handy household tips, always interesting to read.",4
Love this mag and so do the people that come into my work. I see it is often one of the most picked to read.,5
I have never gotten this product so it's hard to know how to rate it.  Wish amazon would send me things in a timely manner.,1
"Love it.  Great magazine, great articles, great price.  I wish Amazon was adding more 1 year auto renewal magazines (instead of removing them)",5
There are way to few helpful articles in these PC World and some others. 80% ads and it's a waste of trees to make the paper.,1
"Wow, Ordered about two months ago, and still no magazine.
If you want a subscription to start at a reasonable time after ordering, go through the publisher!",1
I ordered this on 12/23/08 as a gift and the person still has not received their first issue as of 2/3/09.  Very disappointed.,1
"Seriously Popular Science, I am done subscribing, I have been a subscriber for YEARS and it's like 99% ad's these days. Forget it, I am done",1
"they automatically renew even after you cancel it and repeatedly bill you , they have done it to so many people do your research before buying",1
"This magazine put me off on the first issue because it is at least 50% ads, but I do enjoy the recipes. But for $5 it's descents at best.",3
What I hate is that I NEVER GOT IT!  I am sure I would be satisfied if/when it shows up!,1
"How may I give a less than 1 star review? Their Partisan anti-Trump articles ridiculous, they are on the wrong side of truth and the wrong side of history.",1
"I am a long time subscriber to Texas Monthly and have received the past two monthly issues previously, Why would I want to re-read the same old crap?",1
"best magazine in Texas ,or anywhere for that matter.",5
I have not received 1 copy yet.  How can I give it anything else?  I will probably enjoy it once that happens.,1
"I have not received this magazine, so I can not write a review>
Please let me know when I will receive the magazine.
Tnank you.

Carol",1
Haven't received my subscription yet! I going to give this product more time  to arrive to my home before  I contact who is responsible.,1
Best! Great project ideas,5
"Ordered magazine on 12/27/08.  As of February 27, 2009 still have not received my subscription.",1
"I am unable to review the product PC World, I haven't heard anything from the publisher or received a copy yet.",1
I love this magazine! I think it's my favorite one! I like the price and I also enjoy the auto renewal. They continue to treat me well and the price has stayed consistent.,5
Just tells stats,3
"It's still one my top 5 magazines but has gone downhill in the last few years.  Can't compare to Scientific American.  But, neither is it as pricey.",3
Enjoyed the subscription.,4
My son looks forward to this every month!,5
A GREAT MAGAZINE AND A GOOD PRICE AT AMAZON.  I HAVE BEEN A SUBSCRIBER FOR AT LEAST 4O0 YEARS!,5
"Love this magazine, love my state so much",5
Nice magazine to keep up with what is going on in Texas. Nice travel guide around Texas also.,4
love this magazine!,5
Their magazine is more like a virus than a magazine. I have been trying for months to stop their spam emails.,1
"Way too many, mostly non-relevant ads. Not much substance to the articles.",2
"Interesting but many many ads to flip past, not enough content.",3
"I think it is a very good magazine but the font was too small for me. It expands only to double the size on my 10"" tablet.",4
enjoyable informative,4
"Having been a subscriber for about a year, I find there are far too many pages of ads and not enough interesting articles to justify renewing.",2
Love it! The whole state covered a to z,5
The Best out there today....by any standard,5
A student pilot must-have.,5
"Good practical content for private pilots that covers real world issues, not just areas out of reach of most private pilots such as reviews of Gulfstream G650, etc.",4
A great publication for pilots.,5
"It's a good read but I'd like more diversity.  I had this subscription a couple years ago and it's fairly similar.  There's lots to discuss, bring the new articles!",4
"Ok magazine, other home magazines I like better. Good price thru Amazon.",3
"I thought it was pretty good, enjoyed reading it.",4
Lots of advertising.  Light on content.,3
Not as much information as others I have purchased in store,3
I personally did not like the style this magazine portrayed.,1
Too expensive for my taste!,2
Fabulous recipes and ideas are featured in this magazine at a very affordable price; way less than the supermarkets check-out lanes.,4
"Living in Vegas, I truly miss my beloved Texas.  The magazine keeps me informed of happenings across the state.  The articles and BBQ recipes are just the best!!!",5
It is all bout selling high end stuff. Not much useful here.,1
I get the Standard on my Kindle Fire and it works well.  I find the articles varied and interesting.  It's nice to get a different perspective on issues.,4
House Beautiful is not like it used to be.,3
"Wonderful magazine! Thank you for the opportunity to purchase at a great price!
Brenda Cooper",5
"Left wing, self hating, pinko socialist commy rag. This has nothing to do with the real Texas.",1
I have been reading this magazine for 18 years and I love it. Glad to have it on my kindle now!,5
I bought so that i can show it to my 10 year old son....its littered with tobacco advertisements and very little content.,1
"I really like this mag, but hate the extreme number of ads.  I realize that advertising supports the mag so I just suffer through them.
The ads are why it gets only 4 stars.",4
"If you want to know what's going on in our great state, this is your magazine!  My son loves getting it!",5
A lot of ads almost more ads then articles. Wife still likea them....,3
One of the best home decor mags!,5
Offers great tips on everything from design to storage.  Would prefer more design ideas that are more sophisticated.,4
It doesn't match my style,2
Super Deal!!,5
When will my first issue arrive?,1
"Mostly ads, hardly any content",2
"WON'T OPEN ON KINDLE, WON'T ACCEPT ANY PASSWORD TO VERIFY ACCT ON CNTRAVELER WEBSITE. FORGET THIS ONE!",1
"My husband LOVES this magazine. It is just technical enough to keep his interest, but not too much to where he can't understand the articles. It is a great gift subscription.",5
"Wonderful magazine with tons of ideas and current trends in decorating. Nice color pictures, informative articles and good advice from the pros.",5
Sent this subscription to my son three years ago and he loves it.  I have renewed it for him here at a great price.,5
I love the Weekly Standard. It's a great magazine. I love it and it is highly recommended.,5
"90% ads, no good articles.  Just your regular left slanted, east coast magazine.  Even if your view is leaning left, be ready to read the last months big headline from MSNBC.",1
I would loved to have gotten the before and after issue!,3
Could not beat the price on this. Very nice magazine.,4
Ordered my subscription of month ago still haven't gotten it... And now you're asking me to rate it... So I will rate this a big zero,1
"Great magazine, always useful tips. Although sometimes can be a little ""more"" than needed, or cost as much to build as to purchase.",4
"The quality of the articles has gone down, full of advertisements, will not be renewing my subscription again. - very dissipointed",1
Gift for my dad.  He loves the articles and has truly enjoyed this magazine.  He has also recommended it to his friends.,5
look forward to receiving each month,4
I have had Texas Monthly for 3 years now. Almost every issue has multiple great stories. My only complaint is the amount of multiple page ads (travel guides) in it every week.,4
"Too many ads.  Too many ""Best restaurents, doctors, lawyers, etc."" listings.  Maybe one or two good articles per issue.  Probably won't subscribe again.",3
Love this magazine. Great decorative products and great design work.,5
Didn't order this.  PLEASE DON'T ORDER THIS MAGAZINE.,1
Unrelistic,1
"I cannot say enough about the Family Handyman issues. I love them, they are a great source of information. Awesome!",5
I was looking for a little more fit than this magazine offers.,3
Love the price,5
Very difficult to understand and play.,2
The magazine is chocked full of interesting places to visit and make lasting memories.  I am going to enjoy and make the most of my six issues of this magazine.,4
"This magazine is great, the pictures, writing and even the adds are beautiful. I feel like I'm sharing part of the world I haven't yet traveled in.",5
"The stories, locations, and special interests topics are spectacular and well written.  Would recommend this to all of my friends.",4
Really enjoyed this magazine & especially all the great ideas.,4
More Ads than magazine. A little disappointed.,3
"The magazine has very little content in my opinion. In the end, its ok. I don't recommend it, but that's just me.",3
"I've taken the magazine in the past, but have not yet read a recent issue.  However, I've always enjoyed it previously.",4
My dad called to let me know he got his first issue.  He and mom love it.  I knew that they would.  Thanks Amazon for making it available at a great cost.,5
we renew this every year- my husband loves it! I love it because I can inspire him to make and repair things for the house.,5
"Best magazine ever !!!. Unless you pay others to do all of your house repairs. It includes many tips from auto to woodworking, its good for any guy.",5
i did not order auto renewal....and there was an additional discount offered which i was not given,1
I would like to see more information on great places that aren't only for the 1%.  We can afford great vacations but not at places starting at $500 a night.,3
More than half of the magazine is ads. So much I got bored of flipping thru the pages.,2
I can't review the Monthly at this time; simply I ain't received it.  LOL,1
STILL waiting for 1st issue to arrive!,1
"House Beautiful inspires me to make little changes in my home to keep 'in style.'  There's always an article about using color, and Alex has some good recipes!",4
Couldn't do without this magazine-- been reading for over 30 years!,5
I did not need a renewal and do not appreciate your doing so.,1
"The subscription  started a month earlier than I was told, which was great...",4
good rag.,4
I love these magazines. They are really helpful and help you think of things that you normally wouldn't. They have many great ideas with cut sizes for wood projects.,5
"very big waste of money, wouldn't take it again even if it was free",1
Short on stories.,3
"No better than it was years ago when I quit subscribing.
Too many ads and not enough articles of interest.
Still pretty poor.",2
"Mostly ads anyway, this magazine is only for the wealthy.  I have better ways of spending my money than wasting $200 on a throw pillow.",1
I could not take looking at this anymore than 10 minutes. It was full of articles and pictures of shallowness. Our country is in deep trouble if we listen to these airhead!!,1
One of my favorite magazines to pick up and read. Finally broke down and purchased it online thru Amazon. I received my first issue in about three (3) weeks.,5
I have still not received even the 1st copy. I ordered & paid for it several weeks ago.,1
"Nice pictures on the Kindle fire, but too hard to read.  I like the magazine so I'll continue to buy it (probably in print).",3
Great price and great magazine.,5
"My husband loves this magazine!  It offers great tips on clubs, courses, and tournaments.  I catch him with this magazine at least once per day!",5
"Subscribed through Amazon for one year from July 2014 to July 2015. Got automatically renewed in April 2015 without notice, three months before it is supposed to renew.",1
unusefull,1
Popular Science remains one of my top magazines. It keeps me up with a lot of things happening in the tech world.,4
"This magazine is full of great articles, tips and lots of information for a homeowner. I love to read it.",5
"This is truly one of the best written, most interesting magazines available.  While its appeal is mainly to Texans or former Texans, others will find the articles interesting.",5
"Amazon took their time getting the subscription going, but it is a good magazine.  A little more ""left"" than most Texan's views, but lots of good article none the less.",4
I don't like Texas Monthly.  Never have.  Some people want it just 'cause it's about Texas but it's not worth it.  Read somebody else's copy.,1
"I've always loved this magazine---I'm so glad I finally got around to getting a subsrciption!

YES, there ARE moderates and liberals in Texas!",5
"Four months after sale and still not the first issue. My subscription must be in limbo-land,",1
"This magazine, first issue came before I expected
but good to have. Nicely done. Bought the subscription
for $39 for 6 mos. You get this US Wkly every week!",4
"Ordered a subscription on March 7th, as of April 9th, have only received one issue. Item is now listed as ""unavailable"". Rip off.",1
I have no idea how I ordered this for a whole year. I don't even look at it that much. Do not like it,1
"Great magazine, always beautiful rooms with wonderful ideas, have been getting it for years and it's a treat when it arrives.",5
This magazine is full of ideas. Great do it yourself pictures. Tips from the pros. A year round gift too.,5
"one thing about Handyman, if you have taken it for more than a year you see a lot of repeats.  differant artical and slightly differant plans, but in general it is all the same",3
"They must be really desperate for ideas, or really want to push this product. Is this the best they could come up with.",1
No info for print subscriber to assist in understanding digital policy?  You just  want me to pay...again?  Not everyone buys Apple.,1
Golf magazine has good tips & good analyses of equipment.,4
Says it was delivered to my iPhone but i don't have an iphone. I wanted it to go to my kindle?????,1
Love this magazine and love the price through Amazon.,5
Liberal magazine full of gossip.,1
Disappointed.,1
Loved it .. especially the articles on fashion.,4
Trashy magazine written by trashy people. Complete garbage.,1
This was a pop up notice from the Kindle app on my phone.  Seriously?  Why would I want a gossip mag?,1
Love the ideas for decorating. They have great color photos and the latest styles for everything.  It's a great deal really.,5
Still having technical difficulties processing my subscription?  It's been 6 months!,1
What can you say about the perfect golf magazine?  My husband loves it.  Perfect gift for him!,5
I purchased it for my husband for Father's Day and he loves it!,5
No problem with the product.,3
Horrible. None of the stories are real. Another tabloid rag mag. Won't be renewing. Good thing I only paid 5 bucks.... That's all it's worth for a year.,1
Crap on toast,1
I love the pictures and ideas in this magazine.  I've received it for several years now and just love every one.  It speaks to all types of styles and house sizes.,5
"Especially House Beautiful, and I really appreciate that I don't have to download any other apps just to read an issue.",4
"It's great!!!
I would recommend this book to all of my friends. I have learned a lot from this magazine. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!",5
The only thing I don't like about this mag is the fact that you are always flipping to the back to read the rest of the article. Great travel ideas.,4
I have been subscribing to handyman for many years and I keep up with my old issues for my use as well as those that come by to borrow them.  Great ideas that we all can use.,5
There was nothing classy about the homes or anything else..This wasn't the old House Beautiful that I remember..Another $15.00 ill spent.,1
"This is perhaps my favorite magazine of this type. Interesting, beautiful homes in each issue with inspiring photos to boot!",5
Totally liberal and one-sided. I can't stand how biased this magazine is. Awful.,1
It met my expectations,4
"To many ads and not enough real articlies to shank up my attention.
Truely, a loss of one my all time farvoite magazines!!!!",2
Got three magazines then charged for a renewal of 15.00 so ends up costing 5 dollars a copy and is mostly advertisements. Very Dissapointed,1
I was hoping to find more ideas to use in my own home and suggestions for where to find inexpensive items.,3
"I bought the kindle subscription version, it sucks because of the extremely slow download speed. I will cancel it.",1
Great magazine.  Provides a lot of great tips and tricks and reviews of tools and power tools. and lawn care power tools,4
Always late,2
This is a typical magazine for houses that are perpetually clean and with perfect decorating.  I can't relate to that at all.,3
"I've been reading this magazine since 1970! It's just as good electronically as on paper so far, so no complaiaints. It's still the best overall guitar magazine that I know of.",5
I find that this magazine is too full of advertising and not enough of the guitar lessons material I was looking for.  I won't re-subscribe.,2
"I'm not sure that this is a very good magazine for me... Time will tell, but so far, I wish I subscribed to a different mag.",3
I've been receiving Family Handyman for a number of years and love it. I bought this copy for a friend.,5
"These magazines are packed with lots of ideas for decorating a room, a house, a yard,  but half of the magazine has too many advertisements.",3
Great magazine for gold lovers.,5
"I've been reading GOLF Magazine for years and feel it is the best golf magazine available.  I have just begun reading it electronically, which makes more sense for me.",5
Who knew you could order mags on Amazon. Now we can keep track of them,5
I have been a subscriber for years. Love this magazine. Detailed projects. Good variety of articles. I always get something out of every issue.,5
It is not what I expected.  I defintely do not want to renew for another year.  There are a lot of magazines that give you tips and ideas for your home.  Do not renew.,2
I have always liked House Beautiful. I got it for a good price so was really happy with this purchase.,4
Especially love the designers that tell why a specific shade of a color is one they love. I look forward to every month's issue.,5
"I look forward every month to get my issue and read in bed after a long, hectic day.  I highly recommend it.",5
"I love this magazine and read every word printed in it.  I'm a regular reader of it, just don't screw up and miss an issue!!",5
"I think they liked it second best to Guitar World.  None the less, it came on time and they were glad to try a new magazine.",4
"Great articles, fast shipping",4
Recieved first issue.  Page fell out.  Many pages aren't printed probably and offset.  Need a new printer or they are passing off inferior copies.,1
"terrible, it is not the popular science I remember....and I cant unsubscribe.....TERRIBLE.....DONT BUY",1
Excellent science updates and new information.  I really enjoy it; glad I subscribed.,4
Love this magazine! Great ideas with a very good price.  The photos are great and the houses picked are decorated by fenomenal artists.,5
Science fiction it is not. Does not format well with i-pad.,2
"I received my first 2 issues and the subscription price was great. I wouldn't have subscribe if it was more than $5 dollars.
The magazines didn't have auto-renewal.",3
"Answers a lot of questions around the household and provided some good solutions for home decor.
Great value for money.",4
"Always something interesting, been reading it for years.",5
Written for 90 year old men waiting in dentist offices.  Just awful.,1
"This magazine has had amazing quality photos and ideas for years, they never let me down! Love my House Beautiful subscription!!",5
On time and a great mag. Many projects and handy tips! Can't wait for the next issue. Thanks for a great mag.,4
Price was RiGhT.,3
"love these mags, they stimulate the mind.",5
about 95% advertising...I cancelled it...,1
"I love this, I get the print magazine and love the interactive parts of the digital magazine",5
The best in contemporary literary Sci-fi!,5

Love this magazine.  I love the way they explain colors.  I have used two of the colors for different rooms and they were right on target with what I wanted.,5
"I love this magazine, it has tons of great ideas, tips and tools.  I like it so much I ordered a subscription for my brother.",5
"I am always waiting to get my next issue, every page is extremely captivating and fun, a awesome magazine for anyone who loves science and technology.",5
To many ads.,3
This is an excellent magazine for the husband.  He has learned a lot and gotten several good ideas from it.,5
have not received a issue yet....when will it start coming in the mail....it was a gift very upsetting ...will not do this again,1
"GREAT PRICE, RELIEABLE DELIVERY.... LOVE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL. AND THE EASY WAY TO ORDER IT THRU AMAZON!!",5
Nice to get it online as well as in print.,4
"Wonderful stories! Some short some longer, character driven and full of adventure. It's super inexpensive and very worth it! if you have a kindle it's even easier! :)",5
Great magazine for a great price!!!!,5
"Fun, fun, fun!  Concise and topical. Straightforward, clear writing.",4
"Have read P.S. since I was a teen.  Unique content, easy and fun read.",4
Proof of Heaven was a disappointment.  It was a lot of neurological detail that is not an easy read for a lay person.,3
"Ordered House Beautiful on December 8,2009 - but haven't seen one page of it yet.  Where is it???",1
"I responded to an ad in the print edition of Golf, to which I subscribe.  Kindle edition convenient and no additional cost.  Definitely worth the price of free.",4
Loving the Kindle version - easy to flip and find stories - can't wait to get out there and put some tips to work!,5
Love this magazine.  I'm a big time home improvement nut and I continually find myself finding valuable tips in each and every issue.,5
I love the fact that it gives ideas of DIY projects that can be completed on weekends. There are updates on national codes that assist you in getting the project done correctly,5
Not worth the read.,1
"After receiving the first issue, I hope the articles get better.",3
Credit card charged over two months ago and no magazine yet. How about a refund?,1
Ordered since 27/11/09. Still no mag 31/01/10. I'm still hopeful though. Ordered Cosmo which is by same pulisher and received last week in December.,1
This is another one of my husbands favorite magazines. he has used several of the ideas he has found in the magazine around our house.,5
Smaller than I remember. A few good articles.,3
"Great. Love this mag,was a great price",5
a LARGE waste of TIME and MONEY!!!!,1
"No cover!!!
No table of contents!!!
This is unaceptable!!!
And this is the only one edition for the Kindle!!!
This is Amazon at its worst!!! (+DRM!!!)",1
We have been receiving this magazine for over a year now and we always look forward to it! So many great ideas and how tos!!,5
Magazine is so thin now.  Not worth it.,1
"I enjoyed a magazine I've always liked. Disappointed that it has become so small, but several articles appealed to me tho I am an 85 yr old grandmother.",3
Warning! Kindle Fire won't bookmark your page and remember where you stopped reading. Returns to page one when you return to magazine. Makes this mag close to useless.,1
My nephew and brother love this mag. They are both avid golfer sand look forward to each issue. Easy present!,5
Gifted this and they loved it.  This was a great gift idea and a great way to do it for me.,5
Love this magazine!  Much has been learned from the articles and projects.  Absolutely love the tool tips.  Will be renewing when my subscription runs out.,5
"I have still not recieved my subscription yet you ask for a review of the product

I have submitted three subscriptions in the past three years and I  have never received a single copy.  How about that.,1
Bonnier is not my recommendation for a Magazine subscription provider,1
"Pass on this - The magazine content is just ""okay"" and the magazine construction is way to thin and flimsy.  I will update after I receive a few more issues.",3
I got my love of all things gizmo and tech from reading this as a kid.  I learn new things every month.,5
I cancelled the subscripton before it began because i found another offer at half the price.,1
"FAR more left-wing than I remembered from years ago.  If you tend to be left-wing, this magazine will by and large reinforce your positions.  ""Fair",2

This is a great weekly magazine that gives me updates and information on the most current of events.,4
item not yet received even though order was placed 69 days ago. no contact from company.,1
Wonderful pricing.,5

Love this magazine and couldn't beat the price.,5
Got a sub for my birthday. Enjoying it so far. Excellent read.,5
"Not the old Wired. Seems to be focused on clothing and people. Weird, not Wired,",2
"I wanted to give a gift subscription of PS to my grandson but have changed my mind due to the sexual content of many of its advertisements. Shame on you, PS!",1
"WELL I GUES THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE RIGHT... WOW HOW MANY ADS CAN YOU FIT IN THIS MAGAZINE?? I THINK 90% IS ADS, THE REST IS NOT EXACTLY THE ""POPULAR SCIENCE"" I WAS EXPECTING...",2
Conde Nast editors at Teen Vogue just publsihed an article promoting Anal Sex to Teens... Do you want to support a company that's promoting this stuff?,1
unable to access on Kindle,1
"As soon as I downloaded this magazine my kindle went slowerer and slowerer. Not to mention,it has a horrible topic. Also I think they read this book in hell",1
Hands down the best gift I have ever gotten someone and since we live together I get to read them too!,5
Not my cup of tea,1

Recent issue contained obscene advertizing,1

"Love this magazine, great reviews, articles, etc...",5
"If you like cigars and well done general interest articles this magazine delivers. Clear, concise, and well written. A good magazine.",4
"Wired used to be a great magazine. Recently, its become overly political and its articles have been reduced in quality and quantity. Save yourself the money. Even if its on sale.",1
"Great content, lousy design. The magazine is often impossible to read. I feel bad for the writers who spend so much time on their stories.",1
I've loved these magazines have since I was five. Highly suggest for kids!,5
Could not download.,1
Once upon a time WIRED wrote articles that focused on technology. The End.,1
"It's a fabulous magazine, but it is unreadable on my Kindle.  The type is ridiculously small and unreadable.  The format is wrong for Kindle.",1
Its nothing but ads. Seriously,1
"Delivered to my Kindle, Whats not to love.",5
Too many tabacco and similar undesirable advertisements for my kids.,2

Not what I expected...Will cancel.,1
There are an amazing amount of tobacco ads in this magazine. I expected better content.,2
Many articles were surprising and interesting reads. My students could not put the magazine down.,3
I have been reading this magazine for years and will most definitely continue to do so!,5
Fast shipping... Great price.,5
"OK magazine, just a little basic for me  Not enough in depth on the cutting edge of science.",3
OK but I hate the automatic renewal since there are better prices around.,3
Son loved these!!,5
Not as convenient as a paper magazine - barely look at it,1
Not able to download on Paperwhite!!! What else is Paperwhite for if it cannot download ALL Kindle materials? Disgusting.,1
"What was favored is the following: fast sign-up and download for Vogue, magazine layout, and information well worth reading.",4
Vogue is just a great magazine. Always has been!,5
I look forward to receiving this magazine each month so I can throw it directly into the garbage. 99% adds with 1% fluff content. Awful waste of paper.,1
Can't beat a wired magazine for keeping up with all kinds of topics.  Highly recommended for EVERYONE.,5
Love this mag.  read it cover to cover every month!,5

My young teenage son just loves it! Thanks for the great deal Amazon!,5
Best magazine hands down.,5
"The magazine is 90% ads, oh and even the articles are ads in disguise... Don't waste your money.",1
About half the mag was articles. If I wanted to view ads I would turn off my ad blocker. I cancelled after 2 months.,2
Would have given it a 0 if possible because I could not download it to my Apple Air.  Send emails asking for help without reply.  Please give me a refund for my subscription!,1
Love this magazine and love that I can take it on my devices anywhere!,5
I love the constant addition of articles within the digital magazine.....fantastic,5
Love vogue to the brim,5
Still trying to find time to read the newest issue.  So far so good.,4
Magazine went defunct a month after purchase.  Publisher won't respond to questions about remaining subscription term.,1
"Gifted this to my Nephew and Brother-in-Law out of town.  Arrived as scheduled, they both loved the magazine.  Priced nicely!",5
I am shocked by the number of cigarette ads in the magazine. This prevents me from enjoying it and it also does not allow me to give it to my children or others to enjoy.,1
This was a gift for my daughter-in-law and she really likes it.,4
Lot's of ads Articles boring. Used to be my favorite. Read it in 5 mins and throw it away,2
Another magazine just for advertisements,1
"Sales Paper, lots of advertisement, very short on substance, cancelled after first issue. This Publication has lost a lot in the past ten years.......",1
"I really like the articles, and the layouts are great.",4
Great insight and review,5
Great magazine but has a significant (lot) of advertising.  Was delivered without any problems monthly.  In-depth indormation and reviews of new gadgets.,4
"As many others have noted, there's precious little new or interesting information here. Popular Photography is basically one big ad, a shill for the camera equipment industry.",2
Sooo many ads so little articles,3
I absolutely love vogue!  Always have ...this is the first magi zone I've had on my fire device!!!  Super cool super easy,5
DUH. Love Vogue.,5
Only revived 2 or 3 issues and haven't gotten any more in months! And I order this in November 2016,1
Great coverage of high-tech and current events. A must read.,4
Great paper stock. Nice and glossy. Great that is not a lot of political non sense.,4
A poor substitute for the image-laden actual magazine.,1
"A little less adverts would be great! Appreciate the ""focus"" of the mag has much variety!",4
Nothing new in here,1
Not good at all.,1
"Would have given more stars, however I only received one magazine back in December of 2016, and no further magazines. I didn't know I was paying for only one magazine.",1
"Awful, mostly ads and not much substance. This used to be a nice magazine, but I would pass on this one.",1
My teenage daughters love this magazine!,5
It stopped coming to my address.,1
Far too many ads,2
I bought this magazine subscription as I thought it would be like NY Mag but its incredibly superficial. I wouldn't recommend it.,1
This magazine has too many advertisements and very little good contents!,1
I am not knocking the magazine but it's hard to read on a phone. I would prefer it on my laptop.l will cancel before the free trial period and down load it to a larger format.,2
"I don't like the contents, very poorly put together compared to many other magazines.",1
Fun magazine for people visiting LA for more than a day or two of the usual tourist sites. Also good for locals.,4
The magazine has interesting articles as long as you overlook the obvious liberal bias and BS.,4
Why pay for a book of ads? There was like 4 stories and 30 pages of ads.,1
This has been my most favorite publication. Will continue for thje future. Keep up the good reads. Thanks you again,4
My son and I can't wait for the next issue each month.  Highly recommend if you're into the coolest new technology being developed today.,5
"There is only a small portion that is not ads. Rather than keep the whole magazine I tear out  and file what is important. Sorry,but I was disappointed. Will not renew.",2
What else can I say except that this is Popular Science!  Great magazine with great articles.  The purchase price wasn't bad so I decided to order it.,4
Hard to really view in tablet form.,3
"My favorite designer magazine. I have been reading Vogue for over 20 years.
Couldn't do without.

Cheryl",5
More technical than I wanted.,3
Great magazine to read when you want to know what is happening in the real world.,4
It won't download wirelessly or to my computer for transfer via USB.  I only bought a single issue but are now leery of buying magazines.  This one says Kindle Edition.,1
I am not able to read it. My Kindle will not let me turn the pages.,1
"80 pages of ads and only a few with advice, stories, reviews, or actual photography worth looking at.",2
"Didn't order it, just called to have it stopped. Looked at it and not interested.",1
A good source of young mind info,4
"Too many ads, but for $5. a year, can't complain too much.  Probably won't renew, though.",3
Horrible magazine,1
Way too many ad's,2
was NOT prepared for the money to be removed from my acct!,1
Great  magazine but I cant make  it work  on my Kindle  fire waste  of money,1
"A worthless publication.  Cigarette ads, who needs those?  The free gift of a handbag was a piece of junk.",1
"I love Vogue magazine, but why do they insist on renewing in April when the subscription goes until July?  Next year I will take it off the auto renewal format.",1
Some pages never download I never see pictures I never get it again I pay two times here and on the store,1
Was easy to read but awkward going from actual magazine to kindle version,3
I give it as a gift and the recipient says she likes it.,4
This was an interesting magazine but not my cup of tea. This was a free subscription so this may not be a fair rating.,3
"not that interesting and it messed up my kindle. for the kind of magazine it purports to be, it is very porly designed to work well. my New Yorker magazine works so much better.",2
"As expected, mostly Ads but some good camera review.",3
Vogue has been one of my favorite magazines forever. September issue is the best. Love the food articles by Jeffrey S.,5
Signed up for a low rate but the autorenew came in at a much higher rate and decided to cancel the subscription can get it much cheaper elsewhere.,1
"I love it.  I live in L.A. and really need to know what's going on, and this magazine gives me everything.",5
I can't review this product yet since I have not received it yet.  It's Los Angeles Magazine....but I haven't received a copy yet although I ordered it in April,1
"I've lived in L.A. all my life, it's my favorite place to be, and I'm so glad there is this magazine to cover everything about the city I love.",5
This magazine is perfect and keeps me  up to date on all the best things. Every time a new issue is released i cannot put it down.,5
Lots of advertisement.,3
what drivel - one large makeup ad,1
Cancelled my subscription.  Heavy political tilt.  I just want info about the technology - not why we should or should not be adopting it.,1
A great magazine with some really interesting articles. Will help keep you up to date on upcoming technology and the tech world with a social/scientific bent.,4
"There is never enough stuff in it. They are really thin and a lot of it is ads. But the stuff that is cool, is pretty cool.",3
"I cannot say enough about the Popular Science issues. I love them, they are a great source of information. Awesome!",5
"I bought the subscription for my husband.  He reads it but, he did not want me to renew the subscription.",3
"I love this magazine. It has always had great articles and insight into the inner workings of new, old and future science.",5
Both my girls Love this mag and this was a great deal,5

i only received 2 issues!!!(Oct and April) I thought I am going to have an issue for each month...it is nonsense for me...am i misunderstanding the meaning of 1-yr renewal?,1
I ordered a month ago still no magazine....I wasn't aware it took so long for a subscription. I really like vogue magazine I just wish I could get it some time soon to read it.,1
"They stay on the cutting edge of fun and unique things. I have always liked the magazine. If you have time to spare, order it and have some fun reading.",4
Nothing too in-depth but very interesting.  I bought it as a general entertainment read and it does not disappoint.  A must to foster an interest in science for younger readers.,4
Arrived sooner than expected. Good content and information.,4
A good mix of basics and more advanced ideas.  I like it.,4
Great magazine..daughter loves it,5
"It's a gift to my son every year, and he loves it! I can't say anything better than that. Thanks.",5
"Great and full of need information.  Even do it ur self things.

"I only received one issue of this magazine, really don't even remember ordering it in the first place. Did not like it.",1
"I'd like to find out about getting a refund, since I've been charged for a magazine subscription without getting any actual issues.  This is a very disappointing ""special offer"".",1
My daughter loves the magazine and she is very happy to get it delivered.,5
Love the magazine. Only reason for 4 stars is that first few pages arrived pretty ripped up. Other than that it arrived super quickly it's exactly what I expected.,4
it's what it is,4
Wife has always loved W Magazine and this was a great price. Happy.,5
This magazine is filled with ads and the articles are rarely very interesting (unless you make millions). Not worth my precious time!,1
"Decent magazine, but there is an full page ad for every page of content. Plus, most of it is about new cameras and other products to buy, not about actual photography.",2
Great gift for your more curious relatives and/or friends.  I love the price and my son loves the publication.  What more could you ask for and WOW what a price!,5
"My grandson loves this magazine! He is 16 and has often commented and quotes on stories on what he's read.

.",5
This is for prows .way above me. I will cancel at the end of my year.,1
"First copy came on July 10th, a month after I subscribed. But why was it June`s issue? I did not subscribe for outdated copies of the magazine...",2
dull; all advertising,2
I find the fashions terrible and will end my free trial subscription.,1

I'm sorry but is not for me,1
"Another purchase to read while I'm laid up after a upcoming surgery, like to see some options of in home businesses.",4
"Hey Garton, how much were you paid to write a 5 star review? It certainly detracts from your own credentials. The real reviews say it all. I'll pass.",1
"Yes, it has some informative articles but just cant seem to ""grab my attention"" to keep viewing. Will not be re-ordering.",3
"I hate how the beauty tips don't consider girls with short hair. Also, the fashion it terrible. Who wears stuff like that?",1
"Subscriber still reads,
but too much SPONSORED content.
*Small* print. Please teach more!",3
Best food magazine on the market.,5
wish it had more recipes than advertisements. Most of the places in it are where I will never be/go. Great for the world traveler...but it's not me.,3
"Just full of advertisements.  Zero quality articles.  Not happy with this and won't order again.. I really tried to like it, as fashion is so much fun, but this was a big dud.",2

Sent to a brother who loves to sketch.  He loves it...Thank you!,5
not as broad or specefic in analysis. uses commentary and editorial type format for a large portion.,3
"Good Service from Amazon.. Been reading this mag  for 35 yrs  It's become more and more commercial  over time, but I guess that's what it takes to stay in business..",4
"It's unfortunate that it doesn't include a digital version with the print subscription, as so many magazines are doing now. I would give it a much higher rating if it did.",3
Great writing about culture and cuisine all over the world.,5
Makes it easy to keep up with new developments in the next new thing.  Recommend for anyone who has a desire to learn about new products.,4
Wow such ads in this magazine. A little of every thing. Interesting to see all the things I can't afford,4
Too much celebraties. I'm not excited about who was where and when. I should have stuck with Vogue. W is a lot more hollywood conscious.,3
I give this magazine to my niece for her birthday every year and she loves it!  It makes shopping for her very easy!,5
I bought this subscription for my 2 sisters and both loved it!! It was a great price also at only $5 for the year!!,5
This business of automatically renewing a magazine and making it difficult to cancel is the reason I will never buy a subscription from Amazon again,1
I haven't received any of the copies and I don't know of any contact person or company to complain about this problem. Bogus!,1
"Please, few weeks I sed I don't want to renew the subscription to Wired magazine!!",1

I recieved one magazine and then it stopped coming. Total ripoff.,1

"Love this magazine, have been reading it since I was 16.  Very reasonable price for a 1 year subscription.  Thanks",5
Signed up at a low rate but the renewal rate was too high. Decided to cancel subscription due to rate change.,1
Mag has nothing but glorified ads. You'll get more info from your neighbors kid than from this promotional tag. Seriously!!!,1
This is a truly excellent magazine. Offers a great deal of help. The product rating is especially useful. The wonderful photos are a plus. I renewed my subscription.,5
The magazine is very thin without a lot of substance. Bought as a gift for my father and he found them disappointing and not like it used to be.,2
Great articles but to many adds,3
I would not know if I enjoyed my subscription because I NEVER RECEIVED IT. not one copy. now they want me to re-subscribe. UH...NO...thank you.,1
"I tried this magazine for six months. It has good content, but is not of my desired reading.
material.",3
Its an okay magazine but it doesn't get you all dreamy eyed like Caribbean life and style magazine does.,3
"Everyone month, my daughter looks forward to reading this magazine!  It crammed packed with fashion and teenage issues.  I highly recommend to all teenagers!",5
"It's ok! It first has too many ads. And you need to love fashion to read this magazine, otherwise you will be bored! That's all that is in this magazine.",3
"I purchased this magazine for my step daughter, she loves getting it; it's something she looks forward to each month...",5
"I've only received two copies of this magazine.  I ordered it in December, and it's now August.  No idea what happened.",1
I've looked at this magazine intermittently over the last few years and found this issue much thinner than I expected.  Perhaps future issues will have more articles per issue.,3
"not my type of magazine
perfere more recipies
would not get again",1
This was a gift for my granddaughter. She asked for it again for Christmas this year. She looks forward to this every month. She loves it.,5
Magazine arrives sporadically and we have been asked to subscribe again every month since the first issue.  I am not happy at all,1
"I ordered a subscription and 3 months later, I still have not received a copy yet.",1
Husband liked it okay.,3
Thoroughly enjoy this magazine & love Bill Heavey's writing.,5
This is my second year with this magazine. It has well written articles and provides good information. I recommend it.,4

"I love this magazine.  I can always find something new to learn.  Covers many, many areas of woodworking, from novice to expert.  Highly recommend.",5
Always liked to read F&S. The price is hard to turn down.,4
I get my subscription very late in the month or not at all. Not consistent.,1
I Have not had the opportunity to read Wired. I have not received it! Where is my order?,1
I do not like this magazine.  I only agreed to the subscription because it was free.  I would like to STOP its delivery.  DO NOT CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD.,1
mag is ok it was free so cant really complain but its ok to look at,3
"This Kindle version must be specifically for Kindle Fire because I could not load it up on my Android, Kindle, or Nexus 7, only my iPod. So beware.",1
Too many ads but I guess that is what keeps the price of subscription affordable. It is fun to hear about the latest scientific projects and thinking,4
This is the perfect airplane reading material.  Pretty solid for the potty too.  Sometimes I wish that it went a little more in depth with the sciences though.  I like science.,4
Ordered this for my junior high library.  Girls love it and can't beat the price!  The eagerly anitcipate the next issue's arrival!,5
I am waiting for the next issue before I grade it again.  This one was a little different than is my style of cooking.,3
Good source for new ideas.,4
I bought the subscription for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!,5
I purchased this magazine and one other for my husband for Christmas back in October . He got two issues and nothing more. Very disappointin,1
"Amazing magazine!!! Gives so much info about hunting!!! Love it, and for such a great price!!!! Definitely can't complain!!!! :)",5
"Definitely not an in-depth scientific journal, but it gives you a nice taste of the science and tech worlds.  Sort of a user friendly sampler, definitely worth the $6.",4
It took forever to get to me and there isn't much to read too many adds no substance,1
Love it.  My favorite outdoorsman's magazine ever since I was a kid.,5
This magazine has a lot of interesting information.  I am a beginner so I don't understand everything just yet.  Hopefully I will catch on soon and be able to comprehend it all.,4
I ordered a 1-year subscription 1 month ago and have yet to get the first copy. What's up?,1
Awesome quick. No paper to deal with. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!,5
"Well since I only just got my first digital issue, I can only give it 1 star!
Based on the first issue (May) I'm not impressed.....Yet!",1
I would love to review this item but I have not received it yet.  I don't know if I have to wait a bit because it's a magazine or what but I really hope I get one soon.,1
"I would love to review on this, but I have yet to receive my subscription! When will I get it??? If I don't get it soon, I will expect to receive a refund.",1
Love this magazine look forward to it every month,5
Great outdoor magazine. Like three predicts they rate and review. Wish there was more stories.,4
This is a good magazine. They have redone the inside since the last time I read it. The format is much better now.,3
Unbeatable price for fantastic content. Really love the broad range of innovative science they cover. I would give one to any niece or nephew.,5
did not want to autorenew this tricked me into paying fo it. I am very very very unhappy about it now.,1
Great magazine for the outdoor enthusiasts.  Fishing and hunting are both covered very well,5
OK magazine for the average cook.,3
"Just read their latest issue, alot of bizzare recipes and things I'd probably never make.
Won't renew",3
"Magazine keeps you in touch with respect to new equipment (i.e., advertisments especially but also product reviews) and some technique. But just too many damn advertisements.",3
"this is the only magazine subscription i pay attention to. they have awesome freebies, tips, and deals you can find, and the magazines always come in time.",5
"I ordered this magazine for my 7 years old boys. It was a mistake. There are so many ads inside that it's hard to find any article.
I would not recommend this magazine.",1
out door stuff is always good!!,4
My husband and my dad both love this magazine!,5
"It's WIRED. It's awesome. It's amazingly cheap from Amazon.

Just get it already.",5
"They never sent it to me .... still havn't seen an issue.

so I'd so my review is not so good

T Arnold",1
Got October's issue in November,3
Very good magazine that gives explanations and descriptions that are not overly difficult to comprehend for many age levels  . . from adults to childre..,4
"I purchased this for my father, which was a great investment.  Good stories and hopeful things to look forward to.  Love it",5
Over the top fashion and articles. One can't relate to their products.,1
Too many Ads  will not purchase again!,2
"Nah, hundreds of ads, no real content. Not the magazine I used to like 10 years ago.",1
Not my favorite,3
Great magazine for keeping up with all things tech but also exploring how technology helps people deal with their jobs and improve their home lives.,4
I have not received a single issue of this magazine. So my review would be that it's full of fail.,1
Great magazine for anyone that hunts or fishes. Highly recommended. Top writers and photographers.,5
"Too many advertising,not enough articles.",3
Advertisements overflow,1
"1 star, because we are sick of you, Kendall.",1
"I've always bought this magazine on the newsstand. It's informative,funny and responsible. Now I'll never miss an issue.",5
Very good. I have been reading it since I was a kid.,4
Lots of good info. Must for any outdoorsman,4
"A month later, still no magazine

I have had 4 subs with them in the past and have had problems receiving the magazine in EVERY case

Great mag- terrible delivery",1
Great food publication for foodies,4
Love the writing as well as the photography! Great for cooks who love to try new cuisines!,5
"The magazine in print form is fine, but on a Kindle, it's terrible. The cost is cheap, but not worth it even at the low cost. Disappointing!",1
"Got the magazine for a really great price, $5 for a years sub.  Husband loves the magazine, gotten it for years.",5
Not my style of magazine.  Just ads.,2
Zero stars if I could. Flipped about 25 pages of ads before magazine even started,1
For a fashion magazine I prefer VOGUE hands down.,3
I would recommend Wired to anyone. It has the best price-to-content ratio I have ever seen in a magazine.,5
This magazine is a great resource and a great value.  Got it for my son who is in to gadgets and electronics.,5
Did not enjoy not enough good article for a magazine of this type. tryed to cancel but no avail would not suguest even if you get it free.,1
My dad loves this as his annual Christmas present.,5
This is by far the best hunting & fishing magazine I've ever read. Highly recommend.,5
This magazine is okay.  But it's mostly advertising of designer goods to rich people.  Wish I hadn't gotten it.,3
"I love this magazine. I have been receiving it regularly since I ordered it and it always arrives in good condition

GREAT VALUE",5
I found this magazine to be very interesting. I had lots of information and audition information as well. Loved it.,4
"This magazine isn't nearly what it used to be.  If super cheap deals weren't available, I would not subscribe.",2
"Husband loves it, will get it again!",5
I did not want this renewed....please let me know if you are planning to renew anything else without my permission. Thank you.,1
Too many tasteless ads. I would happily pay more for an edition with less ads and more content. The fashion picks are great though.,3
I think there are better fashion / beauty magazines available. There should be more substance.,3
I did not give the OK to renew automatically!,3
"9 weeks after my order, still haven't gotten my first issue. I manage all my magazines through Amazon and I know they do their job, so its either the publisher and USPS.",1
"Wired is great, but I never got my $5 bonus from Amazon :(",3
"Fantastic value for money but sometimes mundane topics covered, however an overall worthwhile read of relevant scientific subjects and technology",4
"My husband loves this magazine, and you can't beat the price!
Excellent value for a quality publication.  Will continue to renew.",5
An excellent all inclusive magazinefor the avid hunter and fisherman. I've been reading this magazine ever since I was a little kid and I am 43 now.,5
My Dad loves this magazine.  It is full of helpful hints and tips.,5
It's an okay magazine...not exactly what I was looking for.,3
I love Harper's Bazaar!  I always have.,5
One of the best! Great price!,5
This magazine stinks.,1
Waste of money!,1
Do not renew,2
Just not the Bazaar that it was years ago. Will not be renewing this magazine for sure when it comes up for renewal,1
"I never signed up for auto renewal. There is nothing but ads in this magazine. A waste of my money, will not renew!",1
"F&S is a keeper at a very good price. None of the outdoor mags can cover a person's interests completely,  F&S makes stuff that we don't do entertaining.",4
"I enjoyed the fashion and the articles. Some of the pictures were small in comparison to looking at the actual magazine, but you can enlarge it.",4
This magazine has some great content. I keeps you up to date on all the latest scientific projects that are pending. It also contains a lot of reviews for products.,4
My teenage son just loves this! Thanks Amazon for the great deal!,5
"Works fine on my Kindle Fire. Easy reading, good visuals. Way too many ads in my opinion, but a decent app otherwise.",4
This is a good magazine to keep up with the lastest technology out there. I really enjoy reading it. yay,4
Popular Science is a great magazine at a great price. I read every word of the first issued I received.,5
A must read for any science enthusiast in the household. I got it at a steal of a price for a 2 year subscription.,5
"I'm not qualified to give a review on this because I gave it as a gift & have never read it myself. However, I can say that my husband & brother love the magazine.",3
This is a good outdoor magazine! Every issue has something I am interested in. It is easy to recommend subscribing to this publication.,4
"I bought this a long time ago still haven't got my first issue its been months, I feel like iv been scammed!!!!",1
Excellent sporting magazine featuring great hunting and fishing stories along with reviews of new equipment that has been tested in the field.,4
"i love this magazine... it helps me from dressing dowdy, by inspiring me !!.. the photography is done so well and even the advertisements are colorful and interesting",5
"Enjoy reading for the brief technical articles and finding information for more in-depth research. The new product information is helpful, the ads for products can be irritating.",4
I bought the subscription because it was cheap and the magazine always offers insight on new technology and keeps you up to date! I definitely recommend this to anybody!,5
"95% of the magazine are ads!! I bought this subscription for $5 but still wasn't worth it, decided to cancel after first month.",2
"Most of it was ads, and not very compelling ads either. I wasn't impressed. And I won't be renewing. Lame.",1
Way too many ads and never a good article. I don't care that's it's only 10 bucks it's not even worth that,1
"Another great magazine.  Tons of fashion, very interesting articles, beautifully photographed.  Even love the ads.  Super special price as well.",5
"I do really enjoy this magazine. It is filled with good stories, field instructions/tips, and pictures. My only complaint is that I would like it to cover more salt water fishing.",4
"My best magazine, will read it forever. Has interesting stories, the pictures are so real like. I will continue my subscription forever.",5
Miss the old Marie vlaire,3
A perfect example of no science and to much politics.  Just another rag for the climate change crazies.  Don't buy it.,1
I got this for my husband to read on vacation.  Once we got used to the sizing of the pages it was good.,4
I enjoy reading it. It has articles about Field & Stream which are interesting. Good articles about hunting and fishing.,4
you will receive maybe 2 or 3 magazines after that none!. Beware fraud! its not just me review all comments before ordering,1
Great pric and an easy purchase. The auto-renew helps ensure I never miss an issue and I get a decent price!,5
It is mainly an advertisement magazine. I regret purchasing it. I won't renew it again. Can't figure out how to take it out. Customer service for Kindle books is terrible.,1
It is an interesting magazine..not just fashion and beauty but enjoyable book reviews and informative articles.,4
"For those of you who have a broad view of the world and food, this is the perfect magazine for you; always novel recipes and articles.",5
"Best $4.99 a year I spend on my boyfriend, it's amazing how something so cheap can bring so much excitement. He's happy to see it every month. Great choice.",5
it's  a cheap magazine  ... and my dad likes to fish but it has way way way too many ads,3
My husband reads this from cover to cover.  It is his favorite hunting magazine.  He saves them for several months and refers back to back issues often.,5
I'm sure there will be more stars in the rating when the magazine does arrive.  I ordered Cosmo for me ant Bazaar for my daughter on the same day.  I have my second issue already.,1
Tells you about anything and everything you want to know!! LOVE IT!,5
I AM VERY PLEASED IT REMINDS ME OF THE MAGAZINE FROM YEARS AGO. I AM VERY HAPPY I HAVE STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION  TO IT AGAIN.,5
"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE IT AT AMAZON. I NEVER GOT ANY ISSUE!
TOTALLY WASTE OF MONEY! I RATHER BUY A CUP OF COFFEE.",1
Not my type of a magazine.  More for the sophisticated woman.  Will not be ordering it again.,2
Tried 12 times to get them to recognize my subscription and it failed every time! Not worth the effort and a negative to renewing the print mag.,1
useless data.,1
I have NOT RECEIVED any copies of this magazine from the publisher as of today's date (01-17-2013).  It seems to take a while to get the subscription process rolling.,1
"I can not answer untill I start reciving an Issue
I am still waiting on my first issue, it is hard to judge untill I get my first Issue",1
It is just too fussy for me.  I like recipes and these are nothing that I like.  I would cancel if possible.,2
"I'd be happy to write a detailed review of this product, if I had a product to review. I've still NEVER received an issue. I guess I will be contacting customer service.",1
"The magazine women turn to for information on fashion, style, hairstyles, beauty, women's issues, careers, health, and relationships. An excellent experience with my subscription.",5
This magazine gives a broad range of articles on anything from hunting to fishing to shooting.  Great to have laying around.,5
this magazine is just a waste of paper...i guess i am not shallow enough and dumb enough to fall into this high expensive fashion stuff......,1
"It did take a little while to get to me, but still happy with the experience.",4
"Marie Claire is Marie Claire. good price, though.",4
Nothing that interests me anymore,1
This is the one of the best magazine publications I have ever been enjoying reading and buying.  Subscription gave me price i can read a whole year long.,5
"This is one of my favorite magazines. I love the shopping and ""splurge vs. steal"" sections.",5
"We purchased this title as a gift and the recipient loves it already. Great magazine, great price ! Will definitely shop Amazon again.",5
"My favorite fashion magazine.  This is a good price, my first copy arrived!",5
"Great magazine , very good content + great fashion. Love it!!!",5
This magazine is one of my favorite subscriptions. Beauty and Fashion tips and tricks for the win.,5
not for everyone,3
This magazine has products and clothing that the average person couldn't afford. Other than than it was just ads. I cancelled after my trial.,1
I think it is a good magazine but cannot stand that I cannot make sections larger on tap or have a reading view option.,3
"Totally waste of money. Full of advertisements... hardly find any nice articles to read, very disappointed with the way they are not.",1
"Cooking is life , life is Saveur. If you love to cook and eat the food of the world Saveur will inspire you to do both.",5
"I love the magazine, but wish it wasn't auto renewal",4
"Terrible. 80% ads, poor and outdated content.",1
"A very poor magazine, with practically no articles, only advertisements.  I will not subscribe again.",1
I did not order this.  I have no idea how rhis happened,1
"This is the best magazine to keep up with the new technology, new products and just about anything that is new or upcoming tech in every area of life.",5
Love redbook!!,5
I cancelled my subscription because there is not any diversity on the covers! I am a girl of color and sometimes I would like to see some people that look like me on the cover!,1
"It was nothing but ads. I went through the magazine in about 5 minutes. Sad, but I guess that's what keeps it going - the ads.",3
LIKE IT....,4
This has been an ongoing gift. The recipient loves this magazine over many others. The price is always good to excellent .,5
"I found that I don't really like this magazine...at all.
I keep flipping the pages and nothing catches my eye.
Will cancel soon.",2
Its mainly all ads... no real substance. I like articles. If I wanted a picture book I would look on my baby's bookshelf,2
Loved this issue. Read it in one sitting on my Kindle Fire! Love the articles and smart writing in Marie Claire!,5
I orderd this magazine 3 months ago and I still haven't recieved a copy of it.,1
"I have not received this magazing so, I can't review. It was charged to my credit card but not yet delivered.

Johnny",1
I've got my first issue around the time frame as expected in the middle of January but it was the December issue :(,3

My favorite magazine! I read it from front to back. Love it!,5
I've always enjoyed reading Redbook and couldn't pass up the opportunity to subscribe at a great rate through Amazon.,4
Lots of sex/tobacco/inappropriate ads. Seems like there are far more ads than articles. Definitely canceling my subscription.,2
This has always been my favorite magazine and to get a whole year of it for just a few bucks was the best deal anywhere.,5
One of my FAVORITE Magazines! I wouldn't live w/ out it!  Thanx!  Artchalet @ msn.com,5
This magazine is a fun one to skim through. They have articles and some are more interesting than others. I like the celebrities they cover as well.,4
Just wonderful,5
Took advantage of a special to get a year's subscription to Popular Science. I have enjoyed reading the magazine but probably will not renew.,4
I'm on the 4th month of my subscription and so far its been very enjoyable.,4
"I have not received my first magazine yet, hence no review. SLOW Item number 1 is not accurate but it would not except my review without some thing in the stars.",1
"Great stories, good information on health, finance, life!",4
Excellent publishing,5
I love this magazine!!!  Extremely happy that I was able to download it thank you!,5
An awful thing.  Marie Claire came to me unsolicited.  Can't wait to get it cancelled and out of my house.,1
Not impressed at all. Their quality has plummeted dramatically over the years.,1
Liberal garbage,1
No longer good publication.  And look at the vulgar cover depicting Trump. . . no class,1
Absolute garbage.,1
Great magazine!,5
I wish cancel my suscription redbook it was ordered by.  Mistake. Thank you.,1
"The Magazine was okay, but I didn't love it. I probably wouldn't buy it again, because their were a lot of ads.",3
"The Marie Claire was good entertaining and full of good articles. Fashion, beauty and day to day life articles well written.",4
"Thought my teenage daughter would enjoy receiving these and reading them but alas, she was not. Will be canceling this today.",3
There were way too many ads and not enough valuable content -- in fact many of the features were repetitive and seemed recycled. I'd prefer Bust magazine.,2
"Popular Science has a lot of interesting articles that are written in a way that anyone can understand them.
This magazine keeps one up to date on the latest science stuff.",4
"Terrible magazine loaded with ads, minimal articles about mediocre stuff.",1
Not much of style but as you flip pages all you will see is advertisements! Extremely disappointed.,1
just got my first issue today. Not as impressed as I was years ago. I remember how I loved looking at this magazine years ago (20). Much smaller now and not so many ideas.,3
"Ordered in May, 2007, it's July, 2007 and still haven't received any magazines! What's the deal?",1
"where are all of my magazine subscription first issues???????

mark",1
"I absolutely love this magazine.

Love this magazine!,5
Good recipes and desiner tips. A nice magazine that I have a hard time tossing so I have all of them for the last two years.,4
If you sign up they'll hit you up the following year even if you use a gift card don't have an account they'll take money out of your account,1
"A gift for my daughter who is a huge fan of Country Living magazine.  So am I, for that matter.  A great purchase!",5
I love this magazine and you can't beat the price.,5
Im a huge country living fun but this Jan/feb issue is super boring and really small,1
I expected much more. Too expensive for a kindle version. Needs so much improvement  . I was advised not to get it. Bad choice,1
Great price. Love redbook,5
Never got all of my magazines,2
Who buy this crap?,1
What a joke,1
"All they do is bash on politics or policies they don't like. Very leftist and biased articles, Im canceling this subscription!",1
Great as a fire starter because it is Garbage on paper. Save the landfills and your back pocket from the insanely priced auto renewal.,1
Not a bad read,3
Love the ideas and pics !!,5
"I like this magazine, it has fashion, it has interesting articles, health and fitness, celebrities, it has a little bit of everything.",4
"blake looke lovely and exquisite. marie claire delivers. can't wait to dig in and start  reading, and its free. just wonderful",5
Love this mag--great decorating ideas!!!,5

Waste of money. Maybe if you're 25.,1
I've always loved this magazine.,5
"Good reading for fashion & makeup tips, a little lacking in articles.",4
my favorite magazine!,5
Received three issues within a couple of weeks then nothing.,1
"This is one of those ""auto-renewal"" subscriptions.  It took me three calls to finally get all the charges reversed and the auto-renewal cancelled.  Beware.",1
I have been getting this magazine for years and still love it.  Great price too!,5
Not enough info. Too much advertising,2
Cannot read on Kindle Fire because the issue does not zoom out to enlarge.  I would give it zero stars!,1
"More ads than information, I should have known better",2
I enjoy the layout very much and the magazine is very inspiring,5
I love Marie Claire magazine. I read it cover to cover every month and I couldn't pass up this deal!!,5
Great deal and quick service. I renewed this from last year with Amazon. Best deals on amazon.com for magazine subscriptions,5
Lots of great writing. Very enjoyable.,4
The best.  I'm so glad it exists.,5
"I did a $5 subscription on Amazon to try it out and the auto renewed me for a HUNDRED DOLLARS without telling me first. Stupid, will never buy again.",1
"I love this dang magazine, keep every issue-so much creativity it makes my head explode.",5
These issues are getting very thin of late.,3
"The first issue I received did not allow access to articles by columnists.  So far, haven't been able to access anything in second issue.  Will cancel my subscription.",1
"Excellent writing, top reporting and best cartoons",5
Journalism at its best!,5
Don't find it helpful or very interesting. Need to cancel future orders.,1
I didn't really get alot out of it. Too many adds,3
Great! I love it!,5
Just not into magazines too many ads. But great price.,2
ADD ADD ADD + more ADDs,3
You can't beat the Amazon price!,5
not enough cartoons,2
great magazine,5

"After a nasty hate filled blog post on Marie Claire's website, I will no longer subscribe to this publication until their editor and the author of the blog post are dismissed!",1
"Got this as a gift for my Dad, who is a Western History buff and he loves it.  Money well spent!",5
Great magazine!  Everyone I know loves it.  I've bought subscriptions as gifts for people who raved when they read mine. And it is priced so reasonably!,5
I love this magazine. The articles are always great. It's one of the only magazines I actually read from cover to cover.,5
I enjoy Redbook.  There are always interesting articles and celebrity interviews.,4
I've been reading for at least 10 years.  That says it all.  Normally get two years at a time.  Love it.,5
Exactly as I remembered from years ago. I have the time to read again so looked for this publication and was glad to find it.,5
The amount of ads that are in the magazines is equal to the number of ads.  Would like to see less ads.,3
"I asked for the cancelation of this title? Please, do not sent anymore, and credit my account! Thank you.",1
"Love, love, love this magazine!",5
I renewed this magazine for my daughter.  She loves all the fashion magazines and the price on this couldn't be beat (2 years for $7.00),5
"I was so pleased to find this subscription for my favorite magazine at a fantastic price. So pleased, it came quickly, and I will always order my magazine from Amazon from now on!",5

Great deal and the first one came quickly.,5
I have loved this magazine for years...I have enjoyed it just as much on my tablet!,5
I love this magazine!,5
Beware you won't receive your first issue for over 45 days of placing the order.,1

"Consistently good articles, notes, fiction, and reviews. I love this magazine!",5
Way too 'trendy' in my opinion.,2
My favorite magazine filled with inspiration.,5
"This magazine is okay. Not in my top 5 but for the price at the time, it was a good read. Glad I got to try it.",3
I'm impressed - it turns out that Marie Claire hires actual writers and publishes interesting articles and does not simply recycle the same makeup advice from year to year.,4
I had ordered Marie Claire with Amazon on 11/08/09 and still have not received my subscription.  I am having second thoughts in ordering magazines with Amazon again,1
One of my most favorite magazines.  Always interesting and current.,5
Did not like how they automatically re-subscribe you at a high cost,1
some interesting stuff.,4
so far not worked,1
One of my favorite magazines for years.  Love it.,5
My favorite magazine.,5
This magazine is only ok.  You really need to set aside time to read it because it's got lots of pages of advertisements and products spotlights.  I wouldn't renew this magazine.,3
"I love my Redbook magazine, I don't know who won't except maybe men :-) will keep on continue getting that magazine too...",5
Unable to access the newest weekly edition using my iPhone. The software doesn't work.,1
I don't like the style,2
LOVE THIS MAGAZINE!,5
"Some of the articles are interesting, but you have to shuffle through a lot of ads. Would like to have more coupons.",3
I love this magazine and always pass it on to my fellow workers and they get to enjoy it too. The articles are so informative,5
"I can't live without The New Yorker. If I read nothing else in a given week, I read The New Yorker. I love the variety of topics, the comics, the stories, and the movie reviews.",5
"love ""The New Yorker""...I love the in depth articles...I learn a lot",5
Really enjoyed the magazine but the print is to small for me to read. Tried but print size could not be changed.,3
How could I know what the issue is like? Only three pages downloaded.,1
I haven't received my magazine yet - where is it???  I ordered the magazine over a month ago and I still have not received my first subscription??!,1
have many good ideas for my life. Thanks.,4
Stopped coming,1
I ordered this for my mother for Christmas and it is her favorite magazine!  Classically informative and excellent for home design or re-design.,5
Every issue is a must-read.,5
Can't live without The New Yorker!,5
I really like this magazine. It has alot of interesting articles and topics. Plus I like the fashion in it.,4
"Love the ideas in the magazine and the recipes, too.",5
This in one of my favorite magazines. You get so much with your subscription. It is so much thicker than many other magazines costing a lot more.,5
"I wanted to inform all, I am not getting this magazine, not received a single copy so far. I can only comment if I get the magazine.",1
Reminds me of a pseudo-intellectual communist p.o.s. rag.,1
LOVE this magazine!  Thanks for the great opportunity to ;purchase it at an Amazon price.,5
Too liberal Please cancel,1
Liberal trash! Cancelled my subscription,1
Not my favorite magazine and after looking at an issue I can see why. No really good topics to read about. I only paid .99 cent so I cant be mad lol,3
No Thanks,1
This magazine is basically ads. Kindve worthless to me really.,1
"I got the subscription last year, and I very rarely read it, so I didn't renew, but SURPRISE, they charged me for the renewal.  Appalling business practice!",1
"The digital portion does not work on my kindle oasis, the reason for the 1 star.",1
"great pictures from all over the country but a little ""religious"" sometimes",4
"This magazine is a classic! Beautiful pics, good recipes. I've loved it for years and it's my favorite",5
great magazine!,5
I ordered this in Nov. 22th. I haven't received any Marie Claire from Amazon until now.,1
"I ordered this subsciption in June, and it's now mid-September....I have yet to see a single magazine.",1
Someone dropped the ball - this never arrived 8 months later.  Maybe you shouldn't get it through Amazon?,1
Wonderful views and in depth coverage of important world subjects. Keeps you on your toes.,5
The magazine itself is fine but all of the adds that I get mailed now are really annoying.,2
No fashion sense. Someone is be sent to fashion school. The writer's need half a brain because the articles are horrible also.  What happened to my GQ,1
This is under my husbands name because he ordered it for me. Compaired to the other mags in this area it falls short.,1
i love redbook it is a awesome magazine. I am hapy to be able to renew my subscription and think it is a great magazine for all women.,5
Redbook is the perfect mom/woman magazine!  It has a little bit of everything and I don't want to put it down!,5
"Love this magazine, and the price was right!",5
Used to read this magazine. It has really gone down the tubes. Especially when you pick an athlete as a great patroit. Will never read it again. Fashion sense sucks now.,1
Received as a gift. Very basic. Nothing interesting. Ends up in the trash.,1
CANCEL  MY SUB.....YOU ALL CAN GO TO HE DOUBLE L.,1
Colin Kaepernick as a great patriot? if they had negative stars for this magazine I would give them a NEG 5. I most definitely will never buy one again,1
Worthless rag not worth the paper or even digital ink wasted on the publication.,1
Mindless moronic crap for the socially insecure or narcissistic nitwit.  A gift subscription that I wouldn't wipe my ass with.  Great paper for the bottom of a birdcage....,1
GQ?  P-U!,1
Great price on magazine... super great price offer....great magazine for pool side reading. would do offer again when available thanks,5
this also has been a favorite magazine of mine for years!,5
Always the best!,5
"Its oke.  I like to  read this magazine, but sometimes is not so interesting.",3
love it! best deal ever.,5
It is alright. I like other magazines better. Ones with more things for the house. Also ones about clothes and household hints.,3
Redbook magazine is not what it used to be.  Good thing I got it cheap.  Don't bother with this one.,3
"It's not as good as it used to be, but I still enjoy it.",3
"One for my favorite magazines.  I love all the articles.  Good ideas on decorating, etc.,",5
Love this magazine.  Down to earth information from crafts to skin care.  And the price is lower than some I refuse to buy.,5
Worst ever,1
Not a quality mag.,1
One of my favorite magazines,5
Go My 1st mag yesterday. It is 95% ads. For me it's junk and wast of money.,1
Not very interesting,2
I just got through reading my first issue and I absolutely loved it.  I plan on renewing at the end of the subscription.,5
Used to love it. Obviously over the top left-ist now. The New Yorker does not support our great country.,1
I only ordered GQ mag to see the latest fashion trend but I still keep most in their original package,4
it sucked,1
is hard to read it un horizontal way,3
Love this mag!  A must for guys.,5
"Not sure if its a good magazine yet, but the price i got it for was great so i thought i would try it",3
The savings Amazon offered on this magazine subscription was outstanding and ordering online is so convenient.,4
"I enjoy this magazine, especially the Vet's article.  I don't want it auto-renewal though.",4
Ugly presentation on almost every page!,1
Great magazine that's given me some fashion tips I use every day.,4
Always well written.,4
"One of my top three favorite magazines to read, cover to cover.",5
I buy this all the time. I have had a subscription for it for years.. It is one of the best magazines out there,5
I have subscribed to this magazine for several years now and it is always a good read.  Lots of great features and quite a good price.,5
Great magazine. Worst app ever.,1
Using this Amazon app for signing up my Kindle Fire is a labyrinth of dead ends and nonsequiturs. Please improve. I can't believe that there are so many issues ,1
Many good articles,4
I did not order this and I have not been able to find a way to contact anyone to get shipment stopped. Not happy.,1
Would be nice to receive my subscription.  If I receive it I will share my feelings on the magazine sub,1
"I love this magazine. It has great articles, advice, and contests. I love their recipes too! I definitely recommend!",5
"This magazine is usually amongst my favorties, however the first issue I received seems to be very bland and generic. Hopefully the next will be better.",2
"This is my favorite magazine.  Therefore, I give gift subscriptions to my friends.  This was the best rate I could find.  You made me & a friend happy.",5
i have read this magazine since the 80s.  i love it!  this is the only magazine that i read from cover to cover.,5
"Wonderful ... if you're a liberal. Unfortunately, I'm not.",3

Ready great format for tablets,5
Nothing but ads.,1
"magazine good, however i never receive the issues even after i called numerous times to change address and inquire into no deliveries",3
You pay for a subscription and then all you get is a bunch of advertisements. Thats it. The journo is hit or miss. I can believe I paid for a bunch of adds. I felt like a fool.,1
This is one of my favorite magazines. It is always entertaining and I always look forward to the next issue.,5
I was told to go to Amazon and order Redbook and it would automatically renew my subscription. Now I'm getting duplicate issues every month. I'm very unhappy.,1
Just beautiful.  The pages display wonderful images that take me back home.  The price is extremely affordable.  I highly recommend subscription.,5
"It's one of the greatest magazines ever.
Fiction, reviews, opinion and cartoons.
What's not to love?",5
Love love love this magazin!,5

"My favorite magazine.  I put down all the others and read this one as soon as it comes.  Want to go to a country fair some day,",5

It's the best magazine ever!,5
"Not a great man magazine anymore, i spent my money to buy ads. won't buy it anymore since i've been ordered it for 10 years.",1
"OMG, there's just comes with overwhelming amount of advertisements.  It's a OK magazine. It is not as good as once it before.",3
"I have a subscription to this magazine until 2017. I would recommend. They have great ideas on holidays decorating, and so much more. Very inspiring.",5
I did not order it but suddenly got a bill for it.  Please do not auto renew anything for me.,1
"It of course helps if you are in or from New York, but the articles and cartoons hit everyone, everywhere.",4
"I ordered this item in July, it is not December and I have not yet got my first copy. GQ is a good magazine, but find a different way to order it.",1
I ordered the magazine over a week ago. The subscription won't begin until Nov 4 -Dec 4. What type of electronic processing takes 6-8 weeks?!?!? Not doing this again.,1
i THOUGHT IT WAS AUTO BUT I HAD TO DO IT MANUALLY BUT IT DID WORK JUST FINE!  WILL DO AGAIN,3
Enjoy reading it very much. Have been reading it for several years.,4
This is a good magazine with quite a few great ideals and cute updates for around the house.  I would recommend it to all.,4
It's a magazine....it's ok....I bought it for reference because it was recommended to me by someone else.  Not my style though.,3
I have read GQ Magazine for almost 9 years now.  This is by far my favorite magazine to resubscibe to over and over again.,5

"I have received this mag for years and love it.  I recenlty ordered it as a ""thank you gift"" for a friend.",5
"The app is slow to download and has slowed down my Kindle Fire DX. The content, pictures,etc. are fine once downloaded.",3
The New Yorker is an amazing publication.  I've read it for years.,5
Always very informative and entertaining.,4
"We think that GQ still has alot to offer men looking to stay on top of the fashion trends, they always have a fresh new attitude and look

[...]",4

I have not gotten it yet.  Could review if I saw it.  Please let me know if/when it is coming.,1
Can't wait for each new issue - great stuff!  Good hints for inexpensive decorating.  Great ideas without breaking the budget.,4
"THIS IS THE BEST RC CAR MAG OUT THERE. IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR OVER 25 YEARS. IT HAS GREAT PIC'S, ARTICLES, HOW TO'S, AND NEW PRODUCT REVIEWS. ITS FOR EVERYONE FROM BEGINERS TO PROS!",5
auto-renewal is as big a con as  unions or demicrats. these guys have lived in the country if you are rich you can do what they do. real country living is nothing like this,1
"I miss the old Country Living magazine.  Seems like all the articles are about second homes in the country. To me, this is NOT country living!",1
Still haven't received it!  Would love to review it but all I can say is... Never got it!  How long does it take?  It has been almost two months now.,1
"Love it - fine writing , intelligent and thought provoking topics, quirky off the grid subject matter - and of course the cartoons....",5
New Yorker does work on the Kindle! Please cancel my subscription to it and to the New York Times. Ugh!!!,1

I renew this magazine to my daugher as a gift.  She really likes the magazine.  She reports the magazine has lots of suggestions & new ideas to get & stay in shape.,4

I love this magazine.,5
It was a gift to my grandson. He is looking forward to start receiving it when the subscription starts.,4

I still have not received my first issue of this magazine and it's nearing the end of January. ???,1
"Their work out are very effective if you comply with the guideliness for each move and routine. I love it!!!

Been a member for 2 years already.",5
I subscribed to Country Living in May and am still waiting for the subscription to begin. Where are you?,1
I am so glad I subscribe. Reptiles is full of great info and good reads in general. Plus the kids get wonderful articles to do school reports on.,5
I've just terminated my subscription to Country Living because at least 60% of the content is about antiquing. Great if that's what you're interested in... but I'm not.,3
Reptiles Magazine is hands-down the best monthly reptile publication. And Amazon has the best price! Win-win!,5
great magazine.  Look forward to reading it weekly.,4
"Magazine full of advertisements, won't renew my subscription.",1
great articles albeit they are too lengthy...could cut them by a third and provide another good article,4
"Order...and the sub starts in a few weeks.  A great gift that arrives
every week.",5
I don't think you can beat The New Yorker for page to page quality of writing and subject matter. I love it.,5
"Kind of disappointed, was expecting more stories, less ads! Maybe next issues will be more to my expectation.",3
Lots of information and techniques.  One of the best magazines I've read in a long time.,5
Good magazine for contemporary articles.  The poetry is pretty bad.  The comics are very funny.,4
I have been subscribing to the New Yorker for more than 60 years.  Why stop now?  It is excellent.,5
"Good business magazine, with good insights about people.",4
"bought this as a christmas gift, she loves it  its a gift that keeps on giving all year long; and at a very good price",5
I only got part of the magazine downloaded.  The billionaires list did not download.  I shall not buy Forbes magazine again.,1
"The best bussiness magazine. It serves my purposes of knowing world economics

Excellent data, and interperation of the finantial arena.

CarlosP",5
"Forbes Magazine. Save your money. It's nothing but advertisement. The magazine comes in the mail, and I take it straight to the recycling bin.",1
I was able to get a year's subscription for free.  Even if I wanted to pay I could have gotten it for $4 (one year).  The kindle price is not worth it.,1
"you're a business magazine, not a right wing political magazine.  Steve Forbes' greatest problem is that he's NOT HIS FATHER.",3
"I regret this purchase.  Is there any way to cancel?
Thank you

Rita Snyder",1
"As I write this January 4th, 2007, I have never gotten my first or any issue of Forbes (for which I paid on October 2, 2006).  If I ever get something maybe I'd like it.",1
"It took too long to start the subscription, at least several months.",3
I ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it.,1
Two months after ordering the magazine I have yet to receive a single issue.,1
"I love all the pics and info, on 1st issue, cant wait till next one!",5
"I bought the magazin on november, and I don't recive it yet!",1
I am a 16 year old singer and at the moment it is the only outlet I have to know what is going on in the world I WILL get involved in! I love it!,5
This is the best magazine ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gives lots of detail and has awsome articals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
I can't believe you actually want me to review the magazine you pushed to my Kindle without my knowledge or consent!.,1
Once I seen Anderson Cooper on the cover. All I can use this for is Toilet Paper.,1
"This is probably the worst magazine ever, do not waste your money.",1
I made this purchase on Sept 10 and have only received 2 issued. Id like my money back,1
"Really has gone down hill!,, I finally canceled my subscription after they starting writing articles based on their political affiliation!!",1
Love this magazine and so glad I subscribed again,5
Great Magazine been reading them for over 50 yrs...,5
Please do not renew,3
"I was pretty excited about this, but I find he articles boring and mundane.",2
I am also subscribed to Popular Science . I love both magazines,5
My new favorite pastime.,5
There is hardly any content in this magazine and the formatting of what content is there makes it hard to read. Not recommended,1
Enjoy the articles.,4
"Not much content, kinda disappointed.",2
Have not received my first magazine yet.  But I like the magazine and hope to have a long subscription.,3
I bought this subscription for my boyfriend.  He loves this magazine.  Who knew Amazon could do magazine subscriptions.  AWESOME,5
MISSING ISSUES,1
Love this Magazine! The magazine I get!,5
Best thing for the bathroom since $h*t tickets.,5
"First mag I download, pretty easy and convenient. A little expensive for one issue. I will probably buy another issue.",4
wonderful mag..,5
Like most of these magazines the adds overwhelm and the articles under-whelm. Outside is starting to look like a glamour magazine. So sad it use to be a good resource.,3
This is an annual gift for family.  They asked for it and are thrilled to know it was renewed! They love it!,5
"not available on the kindle paperwhite, which blows big time! have emailed outside magizine asking about this, no respose which was kinda expected",1
"This magazine tends to be a bit male-centric and can get wrapped up in high testosterone adventures, but anyone who enjoys outdoor activities should appreciate this.",4
It was OK. I didn't renew.,3
My husband has not been to excited about it.,3
I wish that this had more information about actual psychological issues and studies. It's mostly just a lot of fluffy pop filler without a lot of interesting facts or stories.,2
"Not what it used to be.
More a political rag mag now.",2
"I guess it takes getting use to.  It certainly doesn't replace the hard copy.  I missed all the adds that noted in the back of the mag giving information on vendors, etc.",2
"The magazine has good articles, and I appreciate the convenience of sending subscriptions as gifts.  The recipient appreciates it as well.",4
I bought this as a gift and learned that the recipient only received two of the copies out of the entire year.,1
"Love this magazine, lots of good tips and articles.",5
Its not like the old popular mechanics. It has articles in it that to me don't belong. I won't be resubscribing.,2
Although I understand the reason I have yet to receive the magazine it is still rather irritating.,1
"This was a gift for my father... my dad is the greatest and only gets the best! Enough said, Right? Yep, thought so!",5
Not how I remembered this magazine. Didn't care for it.,2
"not a real subscription! cannot search for products, only read the current issue",1
"Since I have a windows tablet, I have no access to magazines, even though I have been a prime member for several years. Makes me want to cancel my prime membership.",1
So sad to see so many Tobacco ads!  I will not share this with my grandson as i had planned.,1
"Just Garbage  , not even worth the bottom of a bird cage.........ads and filler. It's a shame how something that was good could be so bad.",1
I've been reading PM since I was a teenager and over the years the articles are more leaning toward science and henceforth thinking about dropping my subscription.,1
Lots of interesting info,4
Very interesting,4
"Loved it in the past, however they changed their magazine layout, and I no longer like the magazine.",3
Terrible adaptation to Kindle. Weak articles. Not as it used to be.,1
AWESOME INFORMATION,5
"Have downloaded this magazine to my Android phone before, now this issue is limited to Kindle and Fire? Prime Reading looking less attractive",1
I love this and the price. Great information that pays for itself.,5
I love this publication since I was a child,5
Love this magazine and share it with the manager of the restaurant I frequently visit.,5
It was a good issue,4
Excellent as expected.,5
Good magazine for unbiased product reviews.  I don't like it that they hit me up for a donation a few times a year.,4
Always articles with substance that are easy to read.,4
It is impossible to get connected to their customer service for simple address change requests. I would not recommend subscribing to Discover as a result.,1
OUR FAVORITE.,5
I have a hard copy subscription and there's no way to link it to my kindle fire. Men's health will let u do that. STUPID,1
The magazine usually contains great info and tips for all ranges of fitness enthusiasts.,4
tired and mostly useless drivel ... this magazine has succumbed to big pharma and big industry ...,1
I got a few ideas I wasn't aware of.,3
Wouldn't open on my tablet - can't say much more than that,1
"Great magazine, nice interface, but inability to access discover magazine archive database makes this a poor value",2
"Discover Magazine is my favorite magazine.  I've subscribed for a great many years, and read it from cover to cover.",5
I liked the stories in the issue.,4
American Scientist is much better and deeper. This now seems like it is for 9th graders or something.,3
This is my favorite magazine.  My subscription lapsed so I thought I'd renew via Amazon so I can keep better track of it.,5
Ok but not for rural areas more bigger city options,3
"I'm wondering if the 5 star reviews are paid reviews. This is a useless magazine, not in anyway related to mechanics or its science. Advertisements on alternative pages.",1
I have been waiting a long time to get Consumer Reports in digital form. Thanks to Amazon my wait is over. I am totally enjoying this.,5
Font way too small for a 7inch tablet. When  enlarged it on my hdx everything was out of focus.,1
Have not received the first issue so my opinion is not good.,1
My first issue turned me off to this publication. It was police propaganda.,1
"I have been reading Popular Mechanics for years, I find their articles more varied than before and very interesting.",4
misleading - says full access - u don't get the web lookup site access .. only the magazine in paper and digital form,1
"Digital copy won't play on PC.  Can't read on PC despite being a ""digital edition"".  False advertising.",1
I love this magazine and this is by far the best price I found,5
I get this every year for my brother-in-law who just loves it!,5
I think this is a great magazine and well worth the subscription price!,5
Ordered for my grandson and he loves it,5
a perfect read for beginners & regulars to the gym..... motivates self... creates desire to look better.... road map to a healthy lifestyle..,4
Received one issue and then never another!,1
best price for a year,5
"Good magazine for my husband mechanic, electrician, plumber, carpenter and over-all jack of all trades ! !  Thanks for the opportunity to
get it through Amazon!",4
Not available for Kindle Paperwhite 7th generation. That's a major bummer and a reason to cancel my subscription.,1
Love this magazine.  Love seeing technology and mechanical stuff.  Nice articles.,5
My favorite mag. Good price as well,5
"Everything bad in the world can be attributed to man-made climate change.  No original thought in any of the articles, so I cancelled immediately.",1
cancelled item,1
Have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 using Google. Text and viewing perfect using Samsung,5
Totally a rip off never got a single issue,1
My husband LOVES this magazine and you cant beat Amazon's price.,5
Great magazine! Glad to finally subscribe...,5
Discover is one of m y favorite magazines and having it on Zinio so I can read it again is great.,5
Receive on time and magazine is good,4
"Excellent magazine, the best of the market!",5
got it for my husband but he never gets around to reading it,3
"Excellent magazine!!  Always use to research products/vehicles, etc. before purchasing!",5
Great mag. But the price is way to high!,4
Love this magazine. Great variety of informational articles for those of us that love diversity in news and information.,5
Very good for beginners like me.,4
"I'm sure it is not a new review, but i will say it again. Too many advertisements, and not enough M & F advice.",3
Awesome magazine.,5
I do not at all appreciate auto-renewals.,1
I have two Kindles and an iPad on the way and can't get an app for the magazine? I have a subscription also. Agravating! Can't even get an app for it. Why?,1
Used to get printed version.  Tablet version is okay.  Consumer Reports itself is something I like.  Good content.  gives one an objective viewpoint.,4
If I wanted to see Ads while viewing I would watch an infomercial. What happened to quality information? I think I will start venturing to other health mags.,1
"Print copy wouldn't load on my phone, but I bought it as a gift for my son so no big deal",3
"Used to be great, now nothing but ads and the stories are not half as compelling as they used to be.  Will not be renewing.",1
"Very interesting and outside the box of broadcast media ""news"" that is nothing but entertainment and intonation with an agenda.",4
It's a magazine with articles and three times more advertisements. But when your waiting on someone it a good thing to have to pass the time.,3
It's $24 for magazine and doesn't include online access.  The online access is $30 and doesn't include the magazine.,1
"The subscription is for my disabled son who does not own a kindle, nor do I so the kindle portion of the subscription is not usable. But he loves the magazine.",3
Good read,4
"Love the magazine! The amount of ads can be reduced...some of them are even redundant. Also, received my ""November"" issue in December together with December edition .",4
"mediocre magazine, good for reading in the bathroom.  Shallow and vague articles.  AND THEY CHARGED A RENEWAL WITHOUT MY CONSENT !  ie they will steal",1
Great information on investing!,4
"My favorite magazine, only to be followed by Popular Science - which is a must have also. A good mix of all sciences.",5
"Each issue is filled with so much information that no matter who you are, there is always SOMETHING you can use.",5
"I find this periodical very interesting. Reading his pages I can be informed in a lot of interesting filds.
I would recommend to my friends.",4
I purchased consumer report on Kindle through Amazon. This subscription does not include on line access or even a customer number.,1
"it is not as useful as I would like.  Most of the reviews are for products, services, stores, etc. only on the East Coast.",3
"I've been relying on Consumer Reports magazine for years now when purchasing, anything.  I love the magazine - the reviews are always insightful.",5
Not like it use to be 30 to 40 years ago!,3
great deal!,5
One of the best,5
An OK magazine.,3
Never found time to explore the magazine.  It's written for the more serious investor.,3
"Sad, we only bought our Kindle a few months ago and publications like this have elected to be available only on Kindle Fire. Maybe Nook was a better deal after all.",1
"Consumer Reports is the go to source for real and unbiased reviews.  At $12 for a Kindle subscription, it is truly a no brainer.  This is a real bargain.",4
"My stepdad loves this magazine! I gave him a 1-year subscription years ago as a Christmas gift, and he enjoys it so much I've just renewed it every year after that.",5
"ite's popular mechanics, just what I expecterd",4
More ads than articles. You pay only five bucks for this because the advertisers cover the other $15 a subscription would normally cost.,2
"Great way to get the product you want to get the best item for your money.
I would highly recommend this!",5
Disappointed that it is not in a mobile format. There is some mobile non-subscription content on the Newsstand app,2
"you cannot receive it in your pc desk top kindle app. that sucks,you can keep it.",1
Not the magazine I used to love.  A waste of time and money now unfortunate it used to be really good.,1
"I do not understand why it takes a full two months from the time of subscribing until the first issue is delivered.  The magazine is wonderful, but the service could be improved.",3
Difficult to deal with in this format.  Expensive!,1
NOTHING BAD TO SAY,3
Not at all what I expected,2
Awesome and insightful. I've already learned so much and have dropped some stock I shouldn't have had.,5
Great deal for the price,5
Fantastic product!,5
I have been receiving the Discover magazine for years and I love every issue.  I have learned so much about so many things by reading every issue from cover to cover.,5
"I look forward to it every month and so do folks that visit us.  Very comprehensive, factual and interesting products that are reviewed.",5
Great Magazine Now on my Kindle Fire,5
My husband enjoys this magazine and we have renewed it for another year.,4
Love magazine service.,5
Has many interesting articles.  I have it magazine on our coffee table at work.  Everyone love's them.,4
"I have been reading this magazine for years, great magazine",5
"No protective envelope, post office reads in bathroom before I recieve mag.",1
Great magazine to read in preparation for retirement!,5
Looks good on android tablet,4
"I love Popular Mechanics and Popular Science.
So much new information, and so interesting.",5
I like Barron's better. This is more geared toward retirees or those about to retire.,3
this was a magazine my husband wanted to read so we tried one issue first before subscribing.  Not full detail like a hard copy but enough to make it worth your while.,4
they are fun to read,4
"Now that Smart Money doesn't print, this is the best non-technical finance magazine around-- much better than Money!!",5
Discover magazine contains up-to-date information that the non-professional can understand and relate to. I read mine from cover to cover.,5
"It has good info.. but it's very basic and things i've already heard.

nothing new found here.",3
I only got 1 issue.,1
good reporting,4
Attractive articles. Nice and comfortable to read it.,4
Worth the yearly subscription price,4
"Sound, down to earth financial advice especially for the non professional.",4
Great magazine with lots of useful information. It's worth every penny and more!,5
Best personal finance mag on the market. Very practical and applicable to each of us!,5
Our 9yr old loves this magazine. Looks for it every month,5
Excellent magazine. Very unbiased. Reviews many brands. A must have for every one. I recommend this to family and friends.,5
good financial information,4
Thought it would help me in my finances but all topics were unrelated to me,1
I like the running tips .  It is published bi-monthly.,4
A lot of advertisements.,3
I have enjoyed the two that I have received.  They are a smaller magazine (less pages) but are packed with interesting articles.,4
This magazine is geared more towards professional runners or collegiate runners.,3
Smaller magazine than othe running magazines but really good stories in it that I find myself reading instead of skimming,4
Too esoteric,2
"is very difficult to read these kind of documents because the reader never has an idea of all the information it brink, in spite of the index.",2
Best writing on the planet.,5
"I've read Kiplinger's for a couple years now and this is by far the best price around.  Gives great tips on saving money on items, investing, saving, retirement, etc.  Great buy!",5
We renew this for him every year for Christmas.  He enjoys it and loves to dabble in the stock market.,5
Smaller with less content,2
"I used to love PM, but these days its like a hollow shell of its previous form.",2
"The London Review is very substantive, but I never purchased a copy or a subscription -- just read copies in friend's
home.",1
I found it to be boring. Latin American version is much better and interesting.,2
"WAS NOT AWARE OF AUTO RENEW, UNFAIR WANT TO CANCEL.",1
"I am filing this in my Projects to Complete file,  detail in articles are easy to follow and end results very good looking.",4
Enjoy my $4 donation AMAZON! You suckered me into buying this magazine with your Windows Phone AMAZON app and then the same app cant even open it!,1
All ads. Why would l pay to be advertised to?,1
Dull and boring not like the old magazine that  once was,2
Nothing interesting or useful.,1
"I've subscribed to this magazine for 40+ years and I still like it, however, it seems to be getting smaller and smaller with each edition.",4
My fave mag along with BHG!!! Will continue to subscribe to both and love getting the online information and updates too!!!,5
No comment other than great mag.,3
Not sure that I like the automatic renewal.,3
Many good ideas presented in articles.  Long time reader of over ten years will continue with the magazine in the future.,4
This magazine is weak.  Would never subscribe again.  All the articles are really vague and do not provide any actionable items.,1
"One of my favorite magazines. There are usually several articles that make it a good purchase. It is good for families, parents and people who like to do home projects.",4
Magazine is infomative and interesting.  Can be used to assist in investing or just keep you well informed on the bussiness world.  Very pleased with my susbsription.,4
Too much advertising do not want this magazine!!!!!,1
Signed up at a low rate but the auto renewal rate was a ripoff too high. Decided to cancel it.,1
"I cannot say enough about the Popular Mechanics issues. I love them, they are a great source of information. Awesome!",5
Too many advertisements.,3
"I have always enjoyed reading Good Housekeeping, and that hasn't changes now!",4
Love this magazine.  Been to subscribing to it for years. Amazons price is the best!,5
It's ok but not near as good as it used to be.,3
This was the best price I could find on the internet.  My husband loves this magazine. He reads it cover to cover.,5
"I received Rolling Stones instead?
This seems to be a repetitive issue with this company.",1
I didn't recieve that product so far so I am totally dissapointed. I didn't have any problems with purchases made trought Amazon.com and this one was a disaster.,1
"The mag was good, but a lot of times they just drag way to long a such a little subject.",3
"gave this to a friend for christmas,  he thinks it's great.
I work in a dental office and the patients love them.
Price is fantastic!",5
Great value for the price.  Love this magazine,5
I love this magazine and the fact that Amazon offers it thats even better,5
Not for my age group 65 plus,2
One of the best magazines around.  I have subscribed for years to this magazine it is so informative.,5
Wife did not enjoy the magazine,1
They renewed the subscription after I canceled and they did not credit my account...  Make its clear of start and stop dates as they have assumptive.... renewal practices,1
Has some relivant topics. I'm always interested in hearing about IRA's and 401k's. Good reading for the novice.,4
This is a great magazine  bought this for years we  all read this and find something new and interesting Thanks Hearst  great price and product,5
Awesome magazine!  Loaded with great articles and useful tips. I look forward to getting the magazine in the mail each week.,5
I did not authorize auto-renewal.  I would have renewed at the $5 rate but not at the $12 rate.....and tried to cancel but could not.,1
"Fun magazine to read. Has articles about gadgets (also reviews some products), cars, health, and science. Buy when on sale for an even better deal!",4
Disappointed by poor quality of paper,1
"Always a great gift for Dad, Whether he be a grease monkey, or tech nerd he will find something in each issue that he will enjoy. I happen to be both. :)",4
Not much in the magazine anymore,3
Lame magazine. Obviously promoted by large corporations. Dull and shallow.,1
Magazine has too many ads and not enough content loved it 20 years ago,1
Great content. If you use the harbor freight coupon in the back of the magazine it pays for itself in no time.,4
Very interesting magizine. I really liked  the article on drones. They are fasinating. They can run down criminals to help law enforcement. They can also invade you privacy.,4
A broad view of the technology out there.  Photos of equipment in use and proposed for use.  Easy to read and absorb the ideas.,4
we have subscribed to this mag for lots of years. my son loves it. lots of interesting articles for our aspiring engineer.,5
it ok just don't have time to read it,3
"Where is it? I would like to have it for my Husband, it was a Father's day gift for him.
walkerofcapecoral@gmail.com",1
Like most publications this is filled with ads and the articles aren't as great as they once were or my memory of the old Good Housekeeping is skewed.,3
"Really Love this publication.  Lots of great info.  Excellent reviews of almost anything to include cars, electronics... you name it.",5
So much info.... it boggles the mind. I enjoy each issue.,4
Magazine would be more enjoyable to read if you  could just pick it up and skim through it without having to hunt up the bifocals.,3
"so sad to see this great mag go down hill had,t  read it in several years will not subscribe again",2
If you are a mechanic in mind or body you need to read this magazine. New stuff every month and insight of what is coming in the near future.,5
This is such a great magazine. It has the best articles. There is always some very interesting article to read.,5
If you are interested in reading about topical advances in technology in a variety of fields this magazine is the one to purchase.,4
"I've paid, but I never see the magazine anywhere. Wasted 3,99.- for nothing. I wish I could get my money back.",1
I've always liked Good Housekeeping,4
"I ordered a six month trial version and the very next month they made me renew for the additional year.  A bit too pushy for me, I will not do this again!",1
"I like everything about this product specalily the price it was on sale for black friday week thankyou ,Nice and interesting articles",4
Good quality printing. Great print size for my mother.,4
A staple in my house!,4
Love this magazine and it came quicker than it said.,5
"I have not gotten any issues as of yet
I have not recieved my first issue at this time
It is hard to judge before you see a copy",1
Don'like auto renewal.  Should be able to decide on my own ifI should want to renew. Difficult to cancel subscription,1
"Once this magazine started coming, I attempted to find a way to cancel it. There is apparently no way to do so.

The magazine is mainly ads.",1
great magazine i have been reading it for years,5
Terrible magazine now.  Nothing like years ago.  It was mostly advertisements.,1
"One of my favorite magazines that was a great deal here on Amazon. I get lots of ideas for organizing, easier methods of cleaning, recipes, and crafts from Good Housekeeping.",5
great all around,4
It lacks depth and print size adjustment for older eyes.  Can't subscribe yet.  This may be best viewed in the larger tablets.,1
"This is the best magazine out there. I love their unbiased reports on everything from cosmetics, to appliances",5
Why is this more expensive then the print version !?!? It uses no paper or mailing and frankly should be cheaper for a digital edition not double the price of the paper version!!!,1
"I pay by subscription for this magazine, but I can never download the issues to read.  This magazine is a waste of money!",1
"good magazine, Amazon had a great deal for a subscription",4
My favorite magazine.  Lots of info on many different areas of everyday living.,5
"The magazines were ok but I only received 3 of them.
Total waste of time contacting Hearst Publishing they don't have
extra copies to send if you didn't get it.",1
Why does it take so long to receive this magazine? How can I review this service when I have not received it? Daaaa,1
"I canceled it, was not enjoyable reading.  Prefer the old fashion paper copy.",1
I have bought many magazines from Amazon.com and have been very pleased with magazines and also How fast you receive them.,5
"Excellent service, neatly packaged, arrived when they said it would. I would buy from this vendor again. I have always had positive transactions from Amazon vendors.",5
Just love this magazine,5

Magazine renewal was good but for some reason my existing subscription wasn't used as a base to add my renewal..,3
Shipped quick and just as described.  Thanks!,4
"This was listed as $5 just 2 days ago! I needed to get the address of my gift reciepent and now the price is $10 :(
If they change the price back I will be purchasing.",1
I have always loved this magazine and getting it on the Fire is awesome!!,5
For my mom. Kinda expensive items featured.,3
"Lots of ads, but still a fun read when I want a break.",4
I was excited to get my first issue.  but was soon dissappointed.  Here it is june and my issue is for may.  Not happy.,1
"I find it to be a piece of all from many other magazines not very informative or catching
Or noteworthy",2
"Articles are related to mechanics, I used to get years ago, Very disappointed i will not be renewing my subscription.",1
"Great publication, the information is first class. I have read this magazine since the 70's.",5
"Waste of money. If you're 25, maybe.",1
Always worth reading!,4
Thin. Changed a lot since I was a kid. Low price but not much substance to the publication anymore. It is still fun to read and has some interesting articles.,3
I waited over 3 weeks for this product for a class I was in and was then told it was never shipped from Canada.,1
"I would have thought I would have started getting the magazine by now. I know I enjoy this magazine that why I started a subscription.
Not happy about this .",1
"Great magazine for all the family - even Grandma...
projects and recipes and ideas really can bring the family together with fresh ideas.
Only thing I don't like is the ads.",4
I'm concerned that I wasn't given the opportunity to register a change of address at the same time as the extension was automatically effected.,1
Best deal anywhere!,5
"Lots of great articles on dieting, relationships, DIY ideas, cleaning tips, fashion trends and wonderful recipes to try.",4
great reading good value,4
"Wanted a little more of activities, and planning to do with kids. Came with a lot of comercials, best thing was the food and recepie section.",4

"My favorite magazine! Lots of tips, encouragement and fun.",5
I purchased this magazine when my children were little and now I am a proud grandma and revisited this magazine which I still enjoy.  Thank you for the wonderful Family Fun ideas.,5
I received this magazine thinking it would be fun to have things to do with my grand kids and find it boring .No imagination.,1
"Since I haven't received the magazine yet, it is very difficult to review it at this time.  However, I can review the 6-8 week delivery time as a minus 5!",1
Have subscribed to GH for 36 years and absolutely love the magazine.  I remember reading my Mom's as a teenager and loved it even then.  Well priced through Amazon.,5
I did not get all copies and some came late. Will discontinue,2
I bought this to have the digital copy on my kindle - less clutter - but it is taking forever to download.  I have been waiting all day and I only have the top.,1
"With a grandson who loves ""projects"" and games, this magazine offers  grandparents ideas for both.  We ordered subscriptions for the grandkids family and for ourselves.",5
Unable to read as it looks all funny and doesn't show up like most magazines so small print you cant read it. This was awful,1
Wonderful publication!  I have taken it most of my adult life!,5
My favorite magazine!,5

"There is no better magazine than Good Housekeeping.  The stories are great, the recipes are wonderful and the articles are the best.",5
It's ok but not as good as Golf Magazine or Golf Tips.,3
"Cancel this subscription.

Gary Gronneberg",1
"slow to download, but the embedded videos are great",3
Great for references & product reviews,4
Not the magazine that I used to read but think none are now.  Will only buy it now if I find a good discount.,3
It was a gift and the receiver is so pleased.  She has her 12 yr old daughter pick out a recipe and then they make it together while teaching cooking and kitchen skills.,4
I would not order this magazine from this site.  Ordered 2 months ago and still have not received yet.  Not satisfied with turn around time.,1
"Of all the Pregnancy magazines I have read, this seemed to have a lot of information, good easy workouts and some healthy meals to make.",4
"Should be ""golf"" mag, not girlie mag.  Figure out what you want to be; legit golf resource or just another cheesy mag that will do anything to sell copies.",1
"The app for kindle fire totally does not work if you already receive the print version.  Used to, but no more!!!",1
"Will not download completely. Cannot scroll. Almost useless.
However, the imbedded clips in the fragments I do have look
Like they would be great.",1
not what was in the past...  too many ads and useless information.  tried many times to cancel and they just keep sending me the bill!,1
I asked subscription to be REKNEWED -- it wasn't. I'm angry? Please fix this for me right now nw nw.,1
This one is an old favorite and one I find myself saving articles and recipes from all the time. I gave it four stars only because of the intrusive advertising!,4
This product has not been delivered as yet...the down time as to when it was ordered and to when it is forcasted to arrive is much too long.  Golf Digest,1
Definetley wasn't what i was looking for. I wanted recipes .  Paid 3.99 pretty much for nothing. Wish i could have gotten my money back.,1
"Good Housekeeping is no longer the magazine to buy.  It has too much junk in it and after the subscription expires, it won't be renewed.",3
"Ordered this for my brother in law, who loves golf. What a bargain price for a great magazine !!  Thanks",5

Always bought this and women's day at the checkout counter always had good articles in it to read and up to date ads,4

I haven't received my first issue yet so can't say.  When is it going to come?????????  I think I'll like it if I ever get it.,1
I'm not sure that this magazine is what I remembered.  It seems more family oriented and even my granchildren are grown now.,3
"I get a lot of magazines and really don't have time to read them all--but I always find time to read my favorite magazine! It has great, timely & useful articles!",5
"It has nice content but out of 230 pages, 113 were ads. That's not even counting the smaller ones. I won't be renewing.",3
I got just 2 issues out of 12. I contacted the seller who directed me to a middle vendor who never replied back. Money down the drain.,1
I have read Good Housekeeping for over 30 years and have had a subscription for most of that time.  It almost always has topics I can relate to.  My favorite magazine.,4
"Great buy for the price. Does have lots of ads but makes up
with good enough content.",4
"I was a little dissappointed in the lack of meaningful content in this magazine.  Remembering how it was in the past, it seemed to me that there were way to many ads.",3
Filled with  articles that are up to date in fashion and new products.  It also has great recipes.,4
I still have not received the first issue of this magazine or the Oprah magazine that I ordered.,1
Have subscribed to this magazine for many many years. Lots of good information & great stories. Cannot go wrong with this all around womens magazine,4
This is overall a good magazine.  I like the reviews and have tried a few of their recipes with much success.,4
Really good articles and the best part is that they usually have coupons in them so it's like getting the magazine for free if you use the coupons.,4
It's been 7 weeks and I still haven't gotten the first issue of my subscription. What's going on Amazon? You weren't slow in billing me.,1
"I like the good housekeeping magazine, the
price was unbeatable, and the subscrption
was started very fast.",4

Good reading - uplifting stories,4
Wonderful and relevant,5
A wonderful book. Stories are about real people and are true. I have read guidepost for years.,5
I bought this subscription for my mom for her birthday and she loved it.  She read the first issue and can't wait for the next one to arrive.  Thank you.,5

Great magazine! I only paid $5 for a year subscription & it arrived earlier than expected!,5

Horrible.",1
My long-time favorite magazine.,5
So far..inside the girl on cover..is posing with no shirt....which makes NO sense..not much on health....but lots and lots of ads....,2

Articles well written and attractively presented,4
Disappointing.,1

Okay magazine,3
I used to get this mag a number of years ago and really liked it but it seemed to be all ads now.  Not worth the money.,2

My husbands favorite magazine!!,5
Owned by Fox and is now filled with a ton of ads.,1

Always great info.,4
Love my magazines they come at the right time each month. So excited.,5

"Love this magazine - lots of info. These are keepers, always can go back to to review.",5
Good information.,4
NG has become politically liberal junk.,1
Great Magazine! Have been a member for a long time.,5
I was deceived with the subscription as I received only one copy initially and didn't receive the second one or later on. I have provided one star as I received one copy.,1
This is exactly what I expected - perfect!,5
"I have always loved this mag!  It never disappoints.  I love to look at the pictures, and I'm in my 50's :)",5
"Excellent deal, 7.99 for 2 years delivered",5
Pretty good reading. I would like to see a bit more on Techniques and some more in depth coverage to the creation of supplies and health hazards.,4
Enjoy the magazine stories. Would like more rides advertised.,3
Unfortunately I could not get all articles to download.  Huge disappointment.,1
"Not readable, page doesn't turn properly, font size does not enlarge for reading..by",1
"I loved it
It is. Helpful and gives great advice",4
wife loves this is exactly what she wanted,5
"Everybody knows this is one of the must-have magazine subscriptions if you care about culture, wildlife, or the environment. I read them all cover-to-cover.",5
So so magazine.  It was a good buy but nowhere near as good as American Art Collector.  You get what you pay for.,3
"It's ok, I would like to see more contempary ""popular"" art",3
"My son loves this magazine subscription to Artist's!
The subscription came quickly and we had no trouble with our order.
Thank you!",5
"I look forward to receiving every issue and love the Kindle feature!
I highly recommend this mag. Always a wide variety of articles.",5
"Most of our family on our account has the original Kindle Fire, which this isn't compatible with. Will not renew since only one of us can read it. Really stupid.",1
Not the same magazine you grew up with. Not appropriate in content for children. I cancelled after the first issue arrived,1
I love this magazine and it was a great price.,5
Always loved National Geographic a little thinner than they used to be,4
I subscribed to this magazine over a month ago and have yet to receive a single copy.  Looks like I'll be contacting someone about getting my money back.,1
I got a 3 yr subscription for $12!!!!!  This magazine has such awesome ideas & articles! I love it! A parent must have!,5
World's best magazine !!!,5
The smart phone format is too small. Can't read half the articles. If they switched to a kindle format ( I love my Atlantic Monthly on smart phone) then I might stay with it.,1
Love the articles about techniques and other artists.  It's also great to find out about competitions that I could enter.,5
Who doesnt love National Geographic?  Glad I finally subscribed again!,5
"I really do love this magazine, they always have great ideas and wonderful tips!  One of my favorite parts is the last page...the things kids say...so cute!",5
I will not be renewing.  This magazine is such a quick read that I will leave it to physician reception areas.,3
Not a great situation with the Kindle,3
annoyed that renewal is automatic will not get again ever besides too much emphasis on high end bikers not normal casual riders,1
While the magazine is good I had ordered it the previous year for a gift to my son.  They auto renewed it the following year and I could not cancel it.,1
I can't wait for this magazine to come every month - great articles!! Great for both a cyclist and a road racing fan.,5
"Nat. Geo is amazing, always! Beautiful pictures, quality articles.  Never a waste of time. You will always learn from every single issue.",5
Have ordered this magazine 2 years in a row and have not received even one issue. I will not waste my money a third time.,1
"Ordered this 8 months ago, never received an issue.  This is the second subscription I got through Amazon that didn't get to me.",1
"They keep up with the quality over years, it is always a great and interesting read .",5
Apparently it takes 2 months to start getting the magazine. Im pretty bummed about that.,1

To expensive,1
I have always loved this magazine and when I saw it at this price I couldn't resist what a deal thanks Amazon,5
A recently converted worthless bumholer little rag.  Even lousy fish wrapper paper.,1

NOT THE NATIONAL GEO I REMEMBER ALL ADS LITTLE CONTENT I THROWWITHOUT READING. Used to love it.,1
Maxim is terrible. Not what I remember from their early days. I don't even bother to open the magazine anymore. Can't wait to stop getting these,1
"I cannot read the magazine. The zoom function does not work as in another magazines. I hope they will fix it soon. if not, i will not renew my subscription.",1
Do not get this magazine if you have a kindle. You will not be able to read it in text settin,1
Gender is NOT a social construct. This has turned into a liberal rag,1
This magazine has become nonsense.,1

Great information for all runners. Love the magazine. The monthly exercise tips and races at the back of the magazine are great!,5
"I have been reading Runner's world for years.  I like the articles, training tips, and overall information available in the magazine and online.",4
Very sad shadow of what NG used to be. Far less content and half of it seems to be paid advertisements disguised as an article.,2
"This used to be a great magazine. Now it's a gender bending, value destroying, soul sucking piece of garbage. No thanks.",1
Fantastic magazine at a great price.,5
This magazine is 40 percent ads and 60 percent useless articles,1
I really didn't like the magazine; and wouldn't refer it to others.,3
I find this magazine offensive and it continuously pops up on my Kindle and my grandchildren Kindle.  How can I get this removed?,1
"The photos are good, but the literature is mostly filler. Esquire magazine is better rounded.",3
"Good magazine, but definitly it is not my style",3
Not the magazine it use to be. Last few issues have had nothing but filler information and ads in them,1
I can still not read the the magazine. It says queued.  And then nothing. I think it is better to buy it in the store.,1
"Truly inspirational book, a must-read for all runners. New to the sport or already an adept? Find your inspiration here!",5
No need to weigh in on transgender. I was very disappointed that NG felt the need. Will not renew.,1
Husband loves reading this magizine !!,5
Got this for my mom. She loves this magazine.,5
Nice travel reviews...,4
The coverage of the Boston Marathon after the bombing is some of the best writing I have read in a periodical (ever).,5
NatGeo continues to be a truly wonderful magazine.,5
Not the NG I grew up with. SUPER LIBERAL POLITICAL AGENDA written mostly by women. Mine goes right in the trash. Will not renew when it expires. Very disappointing.,1
I have always loves these mags since I was a kid.  Saw them on here on a deal and am so glad I did they are great little mags the pictures are just amazing.,5
My son purchased this on his kindle and I can't undo the purchase. I had his kindle password protected and still don't know how he managed to buy anything!,1
there are far too many ads for this magazine to be worth while. The articles are not very interesting or useful.,2
"I love this magazine, I've been a reader for years. It has a good mix of fun, informative, and inspirational articles.",5
This magazine was a great read but now it has gone off the deep end with male fashion and other garbage that is no interest to old Maxim readers.,1
"How do I cancel, this is not the Maxim I remember or want.",1
Love the Geographic. This is the best price out there!,5
Wouldn't download into my KindlePC or my Kindle on my phone.,1
one of our favorite subscriptions,5
Magazine has gone off the rails.,1
Arrived quickly.  Love the magazine.,5
No longer a magazine for Western home and garden. It has become a uselessly glitzy advertising piece. I finally gave up hoping they would come back and cancelled.,1
Have always loved Sunset magazine!,5
This is a favorite of mine and it arrived in perfect time for a trip I am taking. Will purchase again.,5
Very disappointed!,1
It was a really great magazine pre-2008.  Something happened and it has not regained its pre-recession density in terms of pages or useful info.,3
This magazine  is not what I was expecting.,2
"THERE WERE NOT MANY GOOD PICTURES , THE WRITING IS BORING",2
what in the world happened to Maxim????? If I knew it had changed so drastically I would have never bought it. Do Not Buy!!!!!,1
"Hey Maxim, it's the 21st century. Please make your mobile version easier to read. Even when I expand the text, it's hard to read. Also, FAR too many adverts.",2
Bad artical about Gender almost through up three times reading it this magazine has gone way down hill give me a break what a joke it has become want my money back,1
Happy with price and product,4
Perfect magazine for the west coast.,5
"great price! I love the maxim company, and i wanted both print and the electronic version so this was a must buy! A whole year subscription for cheap! Love it!",5
"Vey poor magazine, don't waste your money",1
This magazine is loaded with more ads than a free porn site. The banter is dull and articles uninteresting. Good for kindling only.,1

Like best places to live,costs and offers other resources .",5
"This Magazine used to be great.

It is now a total WASTE of paper.",1
Complete waste of time and money.,1
Good magazine always been a reader,4
"A little disappointed, it was the usual regional mag.",3
This is really one of the best magazines - so well done.  Excellent range of content and it's all about my beautiful state.  If you're an outdoor enthusiast so much the better.,5

Hoped for fashion magazine for older women.  This is not.  Will  not renew,2

It's not what it used to be. The stuff inside is boring. I've just canceled my subscription.,1
This magazine has the best pictures and articles!,5
Always loved this magazine and am happy to be receiving it again.,5
Immediately after ordering a subscription I started getting harassing phone calls from National Geographic.,1
I love this magazine. Great resource for places to go/trips to take. Nice pictures. Helpful information. Great especially if you like the outdoors.,5
"Same content as the actual magazine so unless you are travelling and don't want to take the 'zine, fail to see what benefit there is to it, plus it takes an eternity to download.",1
"If I could, I would give this 0 stars. I have yet to be able to download the magazine.  Next time I will just buy a paper copy.",1
Got the first. Then it stopped been delivered!,3
Articles and photography are all amazing.  I've love this magazine for years.,5
A  great magazine over historical time. Covers  a wide spectrum of vital interest.,4
I love Sunset magazine but don't love the pile up of them. I like the fact that I get all of the beauty and knowledge of the magazine without the clutter.,4
"I look forward to recieving this magazine every month! It is always inspiring, has great recipes, and I usually learn about a new place that I have never been.",5
Another great travel related magazine,4
Overrated Rag Publication..... There are much better choices out there to read..,1
"Love having this on my Kindle, no wrinkled pages. :) And I can take it with me wherever I go.",5
Cancel wanted gift went to me just cancel,1
Maxim has gone downhill over the years.  More of a yuppie mag now than appealing to the average Joe.,3
I've been a subscriber for years.  Now I can take it with me as I travel !,5
I enjoy More Magazine. It is a really great magazine for the more mature woman. The articles are interesting and informative.,4
I saw this magazine while at a beauty salon; I loved it the first time I saw it...So I came home and ordered it promptly... I love it...,5
Love this magazine. It is perfect for the 50+ woman who still wants to be fashion forward and age appropriate,5
"I get this for my DIL every year as part of her Christmas and every year I ask her if she would like a different magazine and every year she says no, she loves this one.",5
The new format sucks then I try ed to cancel before the auto renewal date but guess what they still took money out . Terrible,1
The magazine is geared for the 20 and 30 year old.  The pictures are sexy but not particularly outstanding and the articles are shallow.,3
It's ok. Articles kind of boring.,3
My wife loves the magazine.  Makes us want to see the world.,5
I never get tired of T & L.  Always so interesting.,5
Not very in depth.,2
"if you love the western us, this is the mag for you,  excellent pics and well written articles for all",5
"on time, good condition",4
I have been a subscriber to Maxim for many years.  It is the best men's magazine out there today.,5

"Great gift for my husband, Arrived earlier than expected.",5
"Absolutely LOVE this magazine!! Great articles, pictures, and ideas of where to go next for a vacation!",5
Got a good deal. Rather expensive regular price. Good magazine tho if you live in the Southwest. Helpful with plants for your particular zone.,4
It was ok.,3

Maybe I'd have a better rating for Maxim if my subscription actually was delivered!,1
Fluff and ads.,2
Great magazine!  Arrived promptly!,5
Sunset is a pleasure to read. The photographs are amazing and the recommendations are spot on. The recipies are always wonderful too. It's like a min-vacation with every issue!,5
Ordering a subscription was so easy and rhe price was great. Auto-renewal will ensure I don't miss a future issue.,5
"great trip ideas, great recipes, interesting articles! I can't say enough good things about this magazine....even my husband loves it!",5
This is hands-down my favorite magazine. I love the west so it is great to read about the amazing things we can do here in our corner of the US.,5
"I loved this magazine 20 years ago, but it is junk now.  No science left in the pages.",1
Changed my address and it STILL went to the old address. Furious for my $19 going down the drain.,1

One of the best travel magazines there is.,5
"Good magazine, but too many ads.",3

other magazines don't make you take a subscription after 30 days if you do nothing. I don't like that,1
Way too many ads.  This is okay just not quite what I was hoping for. Not even sure how to cancel the subscription.,2
my husband loves it.,5
I have always liked this magazine.thought I should subscribe again.,4
I have read national geographic for as long as I can. Remember.,5
This is the magazine we all grew up with now on our Kindle. Absolutely captivating articles and pictures that will take you to the moment. I LOVE THIS MAGAZINE!!!!,5
Sunset is a great magazine and the price was terrific.  I live on the west coast and the articles pertain to West Coast.  I always enjoy the read.,5
"Thanks ZP for sharing T&L Shady Practices--I was going to subscribe, but not now!!",1

"Where are the rest? The newest one has been out of newstands for two weeks.

Good magazine, though -- when I get it.",3
Good recipes,4
Love chicks are so hot!!!! Plus the articals are hip and coincide with my generation I've been long time reader since I could and think I always will be,5
I don't know how I like this yet. I haven't received the magazine yet.  I bought the renewal a month ago.,1
Cannot tell you how frustrating it is to pay for a product and not receive it. Hope it gets here soon!,1
I found this magazine to be a total waste of my money. I gave it 1 star because there was no way to leave NO stars!!!,1
TO MANY ADVERTISEMENTS.,2
I did not want it renewed.  I want to cancel it.,1
terrible this used to be a really good magazine. Hopefully they get it together like the days  old otherwise they're just going to be replaced.,1
Really difficult to read in the Kindle version. Will cancelling.  I don't like the Kindle version.,2
There are toooooo many advertisements in this magazine.  It's not enjoyable to read.  I expected much more WW recipes and tips.  I won't purchase it again.,2
Love my WW magazine.  I get so much inspiration from the real people and love the recipes and food ideas to help me stay on track.,5
Ok but not great.,3
Not yet received. Why in the world does AMX Publishing take so long? Bad for their corporate reputation.,1
"We did not receive this yet, it has been weeks...  I hope it comes soon so we can enjoy manifesting new travels.",1
I ordered the magazine and was charged over a month ago.  So far no first issue has been reviewed so I can't really review.,1
"National Geographic is a terrific resource.  The stories are important, timely and well researched.  The pictures are memorable.",5
I have not read this one yet but what I have read was up to my injoyment and i will cont read them,3
Reading this magazine on a Kindle is difficult because of the text size. I plan on cancelling this subscription forever.,1
This is my favorite magazine...Great articles on all the newest gadgets that every guy wants...Plus some beautiful girls help as well...,5
"Guess when you rate an article low, you try to make it hard to do so by requiring more and more addition words.",1
"I enjoyed and read Maxim for years, but the current price is a little high for a subscription.

Top quality magazine however.",4
It takes much longer for digital issues to come out.  Will not continue my subscription once its done.  There really isn't an excuse for it.,2
"I only gave it a one star because I can't give it no stars.
How can I review a product I haven't received yet?",1
"Ordered this magazine as a Christmas gift.  Mid February, he's yet to receive his first issue!",1
just got first issue. The info was okay. Too early to say if it's a keeper.  But can't go wrong with holiday price of $5 for a year.,3
Not a lot of pictures or articles too many advertisements to enjoy magazine.,2
First issue was good! Looking forward to getting others.,4
"I was more interested in recipes and food ideas. Articles were same old same old stuff, not very inspiring. I canceled after looking at the first issue.",2
This is an excellent magazine and I look forward to it each month. I particularly enjoy the variety of articles on things that are relevant to current society.,5
"This is one of the worse magazines I have picked up in years.  If you have ""money to burn"" traveling, then it might be for you.  Loaded with advertising and little 'true' content.",1
"Was looking for a magazine with features for over 40 women. It has lots of adds, not too exciting. The fashion and trend advice is okay.",3
"articles ok, however as a person with low vision in one eye, the glossy pages are hard to read and the print seemed small.",3
Great getting NG again.,5
Our family is a huge fan of the National Geographic magazine.,5
My kindle fire is no longer supported by NG!!!,1
Very disappointed my gift to my friend was not received yet. it was going to be a gift but don't know why it was not received yet. My advice look for something else.,1
All most all of it advertising - glad I only bought one month,2
It's okay. Has a lot of recipes but it is low on articles with content,3
"Just received two issues then stopped receiving, my courier told me i hadnt received any further issues, tried contacting but all i got was that all issues were sent...awful",1
"Who does not love National Geographic?  It was the 10.00 for 1 year price I got, that was great!",5
"You can order it directly from National Geographic for $15, but that is just the magazine not the online stuff.
I'd recommend avoiding the middleman.",1
"It was a gift, but I have found good reading and information in the past in National Geographic.",4
"What's not to like?  It is National Geographic.  Beautiful photography & interesting articles from around the world.  Great deal, subscribe.",5
"Who in Southern Calif. can live without Sunset magazine?? The garden ideas are great, the menus are classic, and the vacation advice is always great.",5
All the women they feature are usually 40+ but they look fabulous.  The articles are good and many are about staying healthy.,4
I have enjoyed this magazine for several years but couldn't afford it after losing my job.  This is a real bargain and very much appreciated.,4
I look forward to every issue. The projects are top notch.  I have subscribed to several woodworking magazines.  Popular Woodworking is one of the best.,5

I love this magazine the price was right .for a years subscription,5
MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MAGIZINE!!!,5

Edward Hobbie",1
Did not want to auto renew and so cancelled it.,1
"Needs more content and less advertising. More recipes, success stories, and activity/workout ideas. Maybe even a beauty section too.",3
Enjoyable reading and browsing...love the recipes.,4
I always loved National Geographic.  This is a fabulous way to learn.,5
This was a present but National Geographic is always wirthwhile.,4
what can you say - it's National Geographic at a great price that makes it affordable.  THX!,5
Do not buy ...I received 1 magazine and never received another one.....,1
I ordered this subscription 12/8/09. I haven't yet received  my first issue and was wondering when it will arrive.,1
exactly what I was expecting and delivered super fast! thanks!,5
The beautiful world at your fingertips!  I even love the feel of the pages.  Such a simple  pleasure.,5
Wanted to cancel but was charged another year.  Hadn't even gotten next edition but still charged me.  Done with auto-renewals on this site.,1
Horrible magazine filled with nothing but ads! I knew this wasn't going to be a highly intellectual magazine but when my husband even said he didn't like it I knew it was trash.,1
"this is helpful with recipes and suggestions to stay on track. those of you who do weight watchers, will enjoy this.",4

"Photographs, charts,  reports... So much amazing info and comparisons. I love it",5
"It's nice to have this on my kindle where I can look for ideas for eal time envy where. Whether I have y phone .kindle, or ipad",4
Too many ads vs articles.  Articles are good and encouraging.  Helps you too think before you eat and to plan out your day.,4
"Great articles, pictures and models! It is easy to read on the kindle fire but I think I still prefer the actual print magazine better for this magazine.",4
This is seriously the worst magazine in the world . I got 1 year free subscription and still it wasn't worth it.,1
"Used to be a member in the glory days. Now that Rupert Murdoch bought the magazine, I will never look at the magazine, website or TV programs again.",1
This and Smithsonian are my favorite magazines :),5
I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS MAGAZINE!  Please end any billing and mailing.  I cannot review what I did not read.,1
Absolute garbage from the mouth of fox news.,1
best magazine...period!,5
DANGER DANGER DANGER - AMAZON DOES AUTORENEWAL FOR THIS MAGAZINE  I feel completely duped.  Need to make others aware.  Now to try to unsubscribe.,1
Best educational magazine I truly enjoy and wait for each month!,5
Annual renewal as a gift for my father and he enjoys the content.,4
Fox News with nice photos? No thanks.  Murdoch ruins everything he touches.,1
Not worth it now that  Flat Earther Murdock bought it.,1
"Disappointed that the subscription was a waste of money., only one month out of 5 months received.  Don't waste your time and money.",1
I have vision problems and can not increase the size of the font! Can not read the articles! would like to cancel subscription!,1

One of the best magazines so exciting each month,5
I ordered a 1 year subscription but only got the first 3 issues!! and now they stopped coming.,1
Problem getting it started.,3
I HAVENT RECEIVED THE MAGAZINE AT ALL.... COULD YOU PLEASE MAKE SURE I GET IT... OR I WANT MY MONEY BACK..............,1
I like this magazine. Very interesting subjects and looks good on coffee table. It is a fun little magazine.,4
I took the deal from deal news and went for free Maxim magazine some 4 months ago. Never got it.,1
I used to get magazine before. So far the first issue seems to have a lot less content than before. We will see what comes in the future.,3
The subscription was not consistent didn't receive all the magazines that I should have,1
I ordered this magazine on 8/12/09 - it is today 9/12/09 and I have yet to even receive one issue. Way to go Amazon... or Maxim - whoever managed to screw this up.,1
"Ordered this is May for my son, but he hasn't recieved any of the magazines yet

I WISH IT WAS EASIER TO TRACK SOMETHING THAT HAS ALREADY SHIPPED.",1
Mens Advertisement Journal,1
Love this magazine!! Great articles and hot girls!! What else could u ask for in a magazine??!!,5

Love having this on the go!,5
"I love Maxim. They have awesome product reviews, advice, and jokes. It's definitely my favorite magazine--well, along with Playboy.",5
"I purchased the magazine on december 24 and I didn't get any issue yet, what can I do about it?",1

I still have not received this.  Obviously I can't review something I haven't seen.  Where is my order???????,1
"Always informative, always great writing and especially photography...National Geographic is not just an icon, but a treasure. Getting on my Kindle Fire makes it even better.",5
My family loves the National Geographic magazine.,5
"Until this supports the more common - and better - e-ink Kindle, I won't buy it.

I find it very annoying that Amazon doesn't disclose clearly on the site.",1

"I paid for this subscription over 2 months ago and have yet to receive a single issue?? So, I guess I can't tell you what I think about the magazine.",1
I just received the first issue of a full years subscription and never received another one again.  This is a rip off,1
I love the National Geographic and have loved it since I read my first one at my piano teacher's house in 1948.,5
The new app is not as efficient as the old one. Its harder to access old editions. The magazine is still great.,3

Okay magazine for what it is.,3
What a fantastic magazine! There are so many diverse articles in each issue...,5
Just a bunch of marketing trying to get you to purchase a bunch of toys. Articles are too short and it should have more on fitness.,2
How in world can you charge more for the print version vs. the Kindle version? $24 for Kindle vs. $15 for print...doesnt make any sense to me.,1
EXCELLENT READ highly recommended,5
Get this every year for my grandchildren. They pass it on to me. We LOVE the info it contains and look forward to its arrival each month.,5

"National Geographic is the best!  For years my parents shared their copies with me.  Now that I'm an adult orphan, I have to subscribe for myself.",5

I bought this for my sister and it came with auto-renewal.  Now I can't work out how to cancel the subscript.,1
"I subscibed to this magazine for over 6 motnhs now, however this magazine never reached, even though the statas says ""Shipped"" i was very disappointed.",1
This magazine was a total waste of money. It was 90 percent ads.,1
The recipes are outstanding!  I would recommend this magazine to everyone!,5
Liked it better before New editor took over. Graphics and readability suffered as did variety of food covered. Subscribed to Bon Appetit.,3
"This magazine is okay, but not my favorite.  Good if you have nothing else to read.",3
I thought there would be at least a few good steps to get started.  Not at all what I was expecting.  A very boring read,1
Material is old and outdated.,2
Great interesting articles.,4
I love National Geographic.  It has the best photos and the stories are amazing.  This is a great addition for anyone's reading list.,5
Only received one issue,1
"Got one magazine
And I got a last magazine notice 2 days later
Weird
If its true its a BAD DEAL!",1
It always has a couple of practical recipes. I wish there were more variety; the realistic kitchen isn't healthy 365 days a year. A couple of the stories were interesting.,4
THE WHOLE FAMILY LOVE THEM AND THE TASTE IS GREAT.,5
Never ordered nor did I ever get credit for monthly and a. Hal book.  I have been trying to rea ch anaZon with no sucrsss,1

"It just did not suit my needs.  Sorry, Vivian",1
It is an enjoyable magazine and I will always renew but it s not the best cooking magazine I subscribe to,4
I was very disappointed,1
I thought it would be for everyday cooks...not.  I found most of the recipes required out of the ordinary ingredients. Sorry I subscribed.,1
"The magazine is okay, but not exactly my style.  Nothing wrong with it necessarily, but I would prefer more recipes.",3
Full of garbage advertisement to do franchise. There quality keeps going down like CNN. Now it is straight garbage.,1
"National Geographic has been in my family for generations.  There is always something interesting, and we love it!  Thank you!",5
My favorite cooking magazine ever!,5
If you are looking for actual good workouts look to Oxygen or Womens M&F,1
"Beautiful magazine. Great recipes, pictures, and articles.",5
Fabulous. Love F&W!!,5

GREAT resource...have always enjoyed the features and I find many recipes that I can always count on...especially find the reviews helpful,4
This a magazine that is dedicated to advertisements.  I'm not even sure there are any articles in it.  I search but don't really find any.,1
Very interesting and informative.,4
"Typical Conde Nast publication, pretentious and superficial but fun to read.",3
"Not very many recipes, mostly pictures and advertisements. Not worth the $20 subscription.",2
This magazine is the best for innovators and entrepreneurs all over the world. I highly recommend it for anyone which has or wants to start a business.,5

PRETTY GOOD BOOK. IT WAS A PRESENT FOR MY DAD. HE SEEMED HAPPY WITH IT.,4
Great information for the entrepreneur.,4
Best design magazine ever.,5
My husband was pleased with this subscription. he loves reading articles about these topics and would probably subscribe to this magazine again.,4
"National Geographic is another magazine I just can't do without.  The photographs are the very best in the printed world, and leave little to immagine.",5
Are you kidding?! The BEST magazine hands down! It's a gift for my son that I keep renewing for him every year. He loves it.,5
This shouldn't be considered a magazine since it's nearly back to back advertisement and no valuable content.,1
horrible waste of money,1

This is by far one my favorite magazines. There is nothing bad I could ever write about it. It's an awesome magazine. Get it.,5
"Great price for a wonderful magazine. You can not go wrong. Arrived before it was supposed to, so even better.",5
i love this magazine. i think it has lots of great articles and i enjoy letting my mind wander thinking about living in one of these homes.,5
The articles were informative and the photos and layout interesting.  It is pertinent to the new interest in smaller dwelling places.,4
"I haven't got anything from Dwell, so nothing I could say. I gave one star because I have been waiting for a long time, nothing coming yet. Don't know why??  :(",1
I did not like the layout of the online version. I also did not see any recipes that I wanted to try.,1

"It's always been my favorite to read any time of day/night.....amazing stuff. It's my family treasure, since I grew up in the '50's.",5
National Geographic continues to be the best magazine out there.  The photography and stories are top notch and the topics and locations fastinating.,5
"Dwell is a good mag but like any mag today, more ads than content.  I really enjoy their content.  Very original clean and space conscience.",4
I love the creative and thought provoking design ideas. I appreciate the articles that consider cost saving construction methods and also the interior decorating ideas.,4
"I will never buy this magazine again.  It would not work on my kindle, and when I tried to download again, got charged again!",1
"Too many advertisements and too few recipes. Most included fad foods such as quinoa, kale, etc.",2
Very little actual content.,2
mostly advertisements in #1,2
Entrepreneur is a great magazine to help keep a realistic thought process in business and life. All it takes is one good idea from them and all type of possibilities arise!,4
I bought this subscription for my son who is thinking of starting a business.  This is the most thought provoking magazine in this category,5
"My wife and I both enjoy the wonderful and informative articles. Gives a perspective and insight that is hard to find elsewhere. Truly a ""must read"".",5

I subscribed for a friend in prison and he never got one copy and I complained and never got a response or a credit for anything.,1
It took MONTHS before my first issue arrived.  Lots of ads.  Not as many recipes as I was hoping for.  Won't renew.,3
I ordered this magazine in November 2009.  It's February and I have yet to receive a copy!,1
Food & Wine Magazine is a must for any foodie out there. I love finding new recipes and cooking techniques - and this has them all!,5

I want to cancel this for another magazine.  My granddaughter has outgrown this magazine.  It is a great magazine for some younger adults.,1
"Young preteen granddaughter loves this magazine. We are renewing again this year, she has 2 horses and enjoys showing them, says she gets good tips",4
Not very interesting.  It is not worth the money,1
I bought this as a gift for my parents. They like the publication. There only complaint is that there could be more recipes.,4
got this subscription for my godfather and he loves it. great father's day gift that reminds them all year long that you love them. :),5
Navigation is my only issue. Loved the recipes. Hate trying to find them in the awkward application. Otherwise I enjoy reading it.,3
It is great and it will undoubtedly help me as I work with our 4 year old horse. Thank you!,3
Great magazine. As always I am able to travel many places and learn so much more of the world.....just by sitting and reading. The photography has always amazed me.,5
I have been reading National Geo since I was a child and it is one of my favorite magazines to read.,5
I attempted to download the magazine for 2 days.  I gave up and cancelled my subscription.  Not all of my money was refunded.  So much for a 30 day FREE trial.,1

We have been subscribing to National Geographic for many years and have NEVER been disappointed.  And you certainly can't beat the price ($15 a year)!,5
I like the variety in each issue. From at home to international.  Also articles that challenge at times. I love the readers photo section.,5
A fancy food magazine. Interesting articles but odd recipes. It would be nice for those looking to really expand their cooking tastes but I found it not so useful for my kitchen.,3
"when I signed up I expected the subscription to be added to my present subscription, I received to copies today. Please correct subscription",1
I love this magazine and I detest all the bills and such generated to renew every year.  So easy through Amazon.  I get an email when time to renew and voila!  Done.,5
Not happy at all would like to cancel I have not received 1 yet way to long of a wait,1
Always a wonderful read. Fantastic pictures and you learn something new every time you open it up. Everyone should subscribe at least once then they would be hooked too.,5
"This was a very good price for a very good magazine.  I saved $3 - $5 over

the normal subscription rate!",4

I remember when this magazine first came out and it was a lovely work of art. now it's so thin and full of crap.,1

I wouldn't waste my time on this hate fill magazine,1
Way too many ads; and articles that are broken up for a print edition --which is so silly and unnecessary anyway-- are annoying to navigate to in a digital edition.,2
I love Vanity Fair. So many great articles by so many great writers. Please never stop this magazine,5
National Geographic continues to be an exceptional magazine--fun to look at and read as well as educational on many levels.,4
Love this magazine and great price.,5

A guilty pleasure for those wanting intelligent discourse and the latest on issues and people of note.,4
Love my Vanity Fair glossy!,5
"Actually, less than one star.  It will not open.",1
I can't get it to download to my Kindle!,1
Too much advertising!!,3
"Full of color, great articles, wonderful pictures and ideas. Most of all, full of Martha with the same wisdom and humor that her program had.  This magazine is a keeper.",5
Got charged for 2 copies for kindle fire. Magazine will not download on my kindle fire.  Could not cancel the order.,1
And Martha Stewart classic. great articles and beautiful pictures,5
Have received two issues.  First one had some very useful articles.  Second had none.,3
Beautiful to look at; lots of wonderful content and extras.  The best online mag by far.  And very reasonable subscription price for all that you get.,5
I haven't received any issues to date,1
Great recipes.,4
I got sent two issues that I had already bought from the news stand. Would have liked to choose when my subscription would start without receiving issues I bought twice.,1
I love this magazine...it's one of my favorites. The stories and articles are relevant to today's society and each month I look forward to it arriving in my mail.,5
i love reading it on my kindle and get all excited when there are references to past articles and then sorely dissapointed when the links don't work 75% of the time,3
I didn't even order this publication and somehow I started receiving these in the mail. Very sneaky however this was even ordered.,1
Vanity Fair is one of the best magazines.  The articles are well-researched and of interest to most I know who also read it.,5
was not as interesting as I anticipated.,3
"Too few helpful, relevant articles to read, way too many advertisements. Cancelled subscription.",1
It is a good magazine,4
I have been a subscriber for years and have found the magazine to be less interesting over time. Too bad because the magazines use to be such an interesting collection of essays.,2
What can a person say about a mag subscription.  My wife loves this magazine so purchased it at Amazon.  Good deal...,5
"Was first introduced to Backpacker 30 years ago. Great source of product tested reviews! Excellent stories, pictures, trails to hike.",5
This is really the best gift for people who love the outdoors.,5
Unfortunately it has become yet another resist Trump publication.  I  remember when the magazine was about the outdoors and backpacking not anymore,1
I've missed the last two Vanity Fair issues because they seem to be very slow in processing the order. This has been a disappointment but I still want the magazine.,1
"Comes in time every month and usually has nice and interesting articles, photos are great though too many advertising all through the magazine",4
After 3 months I'm still waiting for the first exemplar.,1
"I started reading 3 different articles and never even finished the because the content was so bad. Also, the digital format is poor quality.",1
"Articles are well written, subject matter is interesting.  Equipment guide is very helpful.",4
Tried to cancel be it wasn't possible.,1
Not possible to read on Kindle or Android Kindle. Too small to see a magazine page. Forget zooming around...that takes away the fun. Please let me read it on my pc.,1
Sister loves loves loves loves LOVES it!,5
Good for collages.,4
"Yes, it has the great Annie Liebovitz  photos and the occasional good article. I enjoy it for the pictures and to see what's going on in the world of the rich and famous.",4
I got a great deal on this magazine and am thoroughly enjoying the articles.,5
"Good read, good information, but articles tend to be biased.",4
"Wonderful magazine with interesting articles for people of all ages!!!  I recommend it very highly, you won't be dissapointed. You will love it!",5
"Have always loved Vanity Fair. It gives you a peek into the lives of the notorious, rich and famous without being a gossip rag. Great writing.",4
This was described as 12 issues per year and the July and August issue is combined in one magazine with approximately the same amount of pages as a one month issue.,3
"beatiful magazine, very good ideas, excellent pictures, good recipes  nice and useful magazine,i would like more desserts recipes. but i like it",4
best backpacking mag. out there,5
"I have read numerous bodybuilding mags over the past few years and Flex is the Best out there. Great infos on nutrition, excerise and pics.",5
Great book,5
Love this magiazing plain and simple,5
Overflowing with unhelpful and biased gear reviews paid for by manufactuars and advertisements and really very little else.  Magazine is over 90% advertising.,1
This is a great magazine!,5
I ordered this magazine subscription on December 15.  It is now February 11.  Have not received one magazine yet.  FURIOUS.,1
"Great magazine, been subscripted to it for years!!!!",5
"One of my favorite ""dreaming"" magazines",5
It's a little ridiculous that I placed this order on 15 August and am not going to get a subscription until November...,1
"This mag is gorgeous....the recipes and articles are so well done, sometimes I just love to look at the pictures!",5
Great magazine I've been a subscriber for years this is my first electronic version and so far I love it,5
I ordered Vanity Fair on May 8th and still have not received the magazine as of 6/09.,1
"Unfortunately, I am still waiting for the magazine to show up at my doorstep. It has been a FULL 5 weeks, so I hope next week is the winner!",1
"Martha Stewart Living is a great magazine for any age or gender.  Martha and her staff are great cooks, bakers, and decorators. My grandma has this subscription and she loves it!",5
"It's a gift for my son, who loves it!  They review a lot of gear as well as writing about great camping/hiking trails.",5
Won't download to my kindle fire. Disappointed!! Please  discontinue my subscription I won't pay for another year!,1
"Really enjoy this magazine, kids love it as well.  They are excited to get it every month, gets them in the mood to hike.",5
"Flowers. Potted plants. Back yards. Food. Bricks. Smart clothing. Islands in kitchens. Home Depot paint. Shovels. So, why did we subscribe? The wife loves all of these.",5
"most was great for the season of easter , good ideas, good outlook for  up and coming items. good pictures of table settings.",4
Glad I looked at the free copy because it didn't fit the Fire screen and was even a little blurry.,1
I love hiking and adventure and I love getting ideas from this magazine!,5
Received 4 issues; 3 at once. Never again!,1
"Received April 2009 issue, but no May although it has been on newsstands for some time. Sent email to Conde Nast via their website with no response.",1
JUNK SCIENCE,1
Price increased $48.99/year for a digital subscription and it doesn't include free fitness challenges that print subscribers get! Canceled my subscription.,1
"Very good content, but too expensive.",4
"After several attempts,  it would never fully download.  I gave up.  I'm a huge Amazon book fan & never had this experience before. Will stick with books & forget about magazines.",1
"I used to get this magazine in high school, and couldn't resist the price Amazon offered. Great magazine!",5

Loved the Billy Goat story. Thanks for all the inside PCT notes.,5

"Wonderful magazine. Great ideas and tips for the kitchen, children, and home. About even with the advertising and articles.",5
"Great subscription price and such interesting, in depth articles!  I also enjoy ogling all the couture jewelry I will never be able to afford.",5
I feel it's overpriced for it's size and information it contains.,3
To expansive in ny opinion.,2
I love these magazines.  they got good information and pictures.,5
"Love the recipes, love everything inside. I'm a foodie and this magazine is a monthly food for my soul. :)",5
"Amazon must think we are fools. It's $4 cheaper directly from Stewart's website.

On the other hand, there appear to be a lot of fools here.",1
Did not. Open.,1
Waste of time!,1
Husband loves his subscription !!,5
Lots of great information.,5
"Prevention Magazine is my favorite, and I read it from cover to cover!",5

Filled with envy about some of the jobs that are inferred by reviews etc...love the equipment  reviews...,4

My son loves this magazine,5
"Great mag, from beginner to a pro... Lots of great articles.",4
"This is the worst magazine to view on kindle.  I have downloaded several and have been very pleased, but this is a waste of time.  None of the pages wanted to load.",1
I thought this was a respectable magazine with evidence based articles.  I was completely wrong.,1
Always love this magazine. Nice to be able to save back copies without all the extra paper.,5
I love this magazine. Always interesting.,5
Quality magazine.  The only complaint is that there is no way to view it on a computer.  You can only view magazines on your phone or amazon device.,4
"Not as good as I remembered it from years back.
Wish I had just taken it for one year not two.",3
"a little too much advertisement to suit me, but a lot of healthful hints.",3
Too many ads. Difficult to read in a kindle. Inability to zoom in.,1
It seems like the magazine just regurgitates old issues... not sure what I'm getting out of renewals,3
I now remember why I stopped buying it over the counter --too many ads.  Not enough info.  You can cancel the Prevention magazine as I don't want it.,1
Kindle screens are too small to read the magazine. Please make available for kindle pc.,1
Just got my Kindle Fire and this is the first magazine I ordered. I am very excited to have a great magazine at my fingertips.,4
Great little magazine on health.,4
Rodale Press has gone from one of my favorite publishers to a plague which I avoid at all costs. Predatory subscription practices and nearly impossible to cancel. Stay away.,1
Lot's to learn.  This helps.,4
This magazine is not worth it. You are better off looking at free material online that specifically fits your interest. Too many adds and biased material from sponsors.,1
My granddaughter loves reading this magazine. She asked for a subscription so I was very glad to get it for her. I renew it annually for her.,5
"like the magazine, but not the way you have to read it.  some pages go down , some pages go across like a book.  confusing.  cancelled subsc.",2
I love to go hiking with my friends and I want my backpack to be as light as I can get it. This magazine has so much stuff in it that will help me out. So far I really enjoy it.,5

"I enjoy this greatly, a lot of great tips and enjoy receiving it electronically. Would recommend it to anyone else",4
Love reading this.  So much information in it.  I have learned a lot!  Lots of important information from ex revise to your health.,5
Disappointed thought that all issues would deal with Clean foods. Otherwise a fairly good purchase. wound recommend for overall information.,3
I've always enjoyed this magazine. It reads nice and clear on my Samsung Galaxy 4 and is easy to navigate.,4
It has alot of great information and tips. Lots of cooking ideas a long with workout info. It was an easy read,4
"Typical magazine with plenty of adds, I like it for the reviews on equipment.  Over all I like it, this is the 2-3 year of me having the subscription if that says anything",4
Disappointed.  Got my first issue and it's so hard to read because the advertisements overwhelm the articles.  And thin - not much to read.,2
"I always find wonderful, usable, most current health info in this well done publication.
It has become a go to source for me and my family.",5
I didn't realize how much this magazine would feel like an ad circular. I can't really tell the difference between the ads and the articles. Makes me trust the articles way less.,2
I love getting this magazine. It is always full of so much information about health. Often the suggestions are natural.,5
"The history and track-record of this periodical speaks for itself.  My wife, mother, mother-in-law and other relatives have learned a lot from it over the years.",5
Nice magazine to give as a gift and easy to send via amazon. My friends love it And I like sending it,4
"I am the leader of our local T.O.P.S. group, and there is a lot of information that is very helpful for our meetings.  From excercize to eating well.",5
"I might be interested in getting this item but it is blocked from the Kindle App on Windows 8, so I cannot get it on my laptop or tablet.",1
"I know that I would really like the magazine IF I WOULD ever get it! Maybe I am used to immediate electronic info, but, over a month now...really?",1
"I'm already a subscriber, so when I saw a 1 year subscription for only 6 bucks, I pounced on it to extend my subscription.  Great deal!",5

"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this magazine.  Soooo many informative articles about health and living.  Lots of tips and pointers that will keep you going.",5
I always find a lot of good information on health in this magazine. always find articles that I have an interest in.,4
I really like prevention magazine.  Sometimes I do find that they repeat themselves in different issues. I would still recommend it.,4
I don't find I learn anything  new anymore :(  I used to love this magazine but I can get more current info online I guess.,3
"Every issue I have received is full of interesting articles, very helpful health and diet information. Love every issue I have received.",5
I have a paper version of Prevention..but I can not signup to get a kindle version? All my other  other magazines allow me to sign in and download the online version...what gives?,1
"Quick easy way to keep up with health news and some good  easy recipes.  Wish all the print was in black on white instead of ""cutsey"" colors.",4
Good information about everyday issues. I like that its a small magazine. I can carry it in my purse to read when I'm at lunch.,4
"This magazine contains plenty of useful information. I really enjoy it.
Would suggest this magazine to most anyone who is into fitness and health.",4
"I don't know who could possibly like this magazine.  If you are into fad diets then this magazine is for you, otherwise don't waste your money.",1
"not only was the 1st issue delivered,too fast, an older issue was also sent.  I had already purchased both issues at the news stand",3
"Great magazine, chock full of helpful information.  I read it cover to cover every month.",5
"Every month, I find incredibly important health info in this magazine.  The info on the latest nutrition studies make this a must read.",5
"Prevention  Magazine

I think that Prevention Magazine is the best general purpose health  magazine out there for the public at large.

Gunner  January, 2008",5
Not my style of magazine.,2
Very good magazine. I like the way it is put together and fine layout of the articles.,4
It seems there area lot more ads and less advice about travel and food recipes,3
Love this magazine.  Have been a subscriber for over 10 years.  Lots of great things to do locally and within a days drive.,5
I have loved this magazine since I found it up in the Midwest one time.....,5
Great magazine.  Interesting insight into many areas of interest,4
This issue did not catch my interest as some others I have had but I am loking forward to future ones.,3
"Love this magazine.  Miss living in the Midwest (Ohio, Michigan).  We visit every year and hope to live there again some day.",5
"I would not buy this magazine again as there are too many advertisements.  Also, the magazine seems to be written for the upper class instead of for every one.",2
Very inane magazine. Only purchased to fulfill a requirement. Very little real content. Just really not my kind of reading.,1
"Best magazine for all midwest places to visit, wide variety of suggested things to see and do with gorgeous photos.",5
great! was easy to load and loved the ease of readi g this. will definately get again! nice and colleges,5
I love this magazine. It's giving me so much useful information on how to plan my upcoming wedding.,5
I have only recieved two magazines and have had it for almost a year! Waste of money!!,1
so overwhelming...,1
"This magazine has great ideas, plenty of pictures to add to my idea binder, and I couldn't be happier with my subscription.",5
"I wast impress with the content of the magazine I hope the other issues come with better articles
I will not recommend",2
"This magazine comes so undersized, it's smaller in every way compared to most magazines. I was very surprised when I got it. Not worth it IMO.",2
"Have not as of July 4, 2012 received any magazines. I will galdly review your survey when I received my first magazine.",1
Not bad but prefer recoil or ballistic magazine,3
Rifle Shooter is an interesting magazine.  More informative than most mags.  Usable information.,4
Has A Lot Of Info And Product. Data On Shooting Equipment For RIfle Shooters And New Products On Rifles Like Looks .,4
I have subscribed to this publication since the first issue was on the newsstand. This is one of the best publications dedicated to rifles out there.,5
"Another BS mag for pre teens, no i don't want my daughters read this rubbish they are worth more.",1
It finally arrived and she loves it.,5
Always  late,2
. Lots of gossip and pics which is good. My daughter's only gripe is that the posters are so small. She has been getting it for about 2 years now.,4
Easy and convenient to order. My tween loves this magazine.,5
It never arived! DO NOT trust it!! I ordered it over 2 months ago and i never got a single one!,1
"J-14 Magazine, was a gift for my Granddaughter. She loves the full size posters in each magazine. She has them all over the walls in her bedroom.",5
Have paid for it but have yet to received it?????????????????????????????? Please check into it and let me know the status!,1
My daughter asks for this magazine time and time again.  She loves the current info on her favorite stars and the pictures are the tops.,4
"received 3 issues, then it stopped, and we have been getting renewal requests since then.  Do not purchase this ever!!!",1
On the magizine pic it shows an old one I just supscribed in 2012 will I get those old issue plz help thnks,1

"I purchased this mag. on 3/29, it is now 5/13 and I still have not received it.",1
"I have not received this item yet, so I cannot give it a review.",1
my mother loves this magazine it keeps her actively reading she reads npw more than gets to follow the program on tv,5
I do not understand why this magazine is not available on Kindle.  That is the only reason I wanted a Kindle Fire but now I guess I don't.,1
I spent so much more just picking this up at the grocery store much better deal to have it mailed to me. I love my Soaps in Depth,5
I just love my soaps,5
I have reading Soaps in-depth for years.  I really enjoy learning about the actor and actresses.  I have been watching the CBS Soaps since the 50's.,4
Would love to review if I had received it but I have not gotten the first issue yet!!  Any idea why?,1
This is the best soap opera magazine that I've seen.  A must-have for soap lovers like me!  :),5
Hope you want your daughter to do drugs and start being sexually  active at a young age. This magazine has inappropriate articles and is terrible for young girls.,1
Only one issue so far. Ok but is not anywhere close to Birds and Blooms,3
NICE BLEND OF INFORMATION. THIS PUBLICATION IS FOR BEGINNER AND ADVANCED BIRD WATCHERS! GREAT INFORMATION AND TIPS. I LOVE & RECOMMEND THIS MAGAZINE!,5
"This is absolutely not a magazine for tweens.  Completely inappropriate content for 10+, middle schoolers.

enough said.",1
"Try Discovery Girls.....more appropriate for younger girls. Girls on cover are same age group. Not celebs,etc.... Reg everyday girls.",1
Articles about how to lose weight?  How to attract a guy? Celebrity gossip?  Is it really healthy to let a 10 yr old girl read this?  NO!!!!,1
This magazine should change the ages to at least over the age of 13!!  Young girls get thrown info on obsessing over boys at way too young an age!!,1
"THIS MAGAZINE IS FUN,COOL,AND HELPS YOU WITH PROBLEMS.
THIS IS GREAT FOR10-15 YEAR OLD KIDS.THIS MAGAZINE IS AWESOME!!!!!!",5
"This magazine was ok. Some articles are good,but you don't get much out of it. My advice is to get one from a store and if you like it, subscribe to it on Amazon!",3
My brother loves this! And I was surprised at how fast they came and how much did come! The price was a steal! I'm very happy with this product!,5
"Good product has a little something for everyone, which is nice that the theme isn't focused in one general direction.",4
"Have received the first monthly issue and it appears to be
a good value for the price.",4
Just not the kind of reporting I expected. Search online and you will get better information for less.,2
"I've been a Mac user for 20 years and never subscribed to a computer magazine. In two issues, I've already learned a couple of new tricks. Well worth the price.",4
Great Magazine and love to always keep up on all the things that are available for my Mac.,5
"Stuffed full of adds, this mag occasionally has some helpful articles and reviews, but I doubt there are any that couldn't be found for free on the net.",3
What else is there to say?  This mag beats all others hands down!  This is by far the best deal on it too!  Happy Macin',5
"This periodical is one of the best I have ever received. The articles are well thought out, and the photography is spectacular.",5
"I was very pleased with this purchase and will be happy to purchase from Amazon again.

Thanks again,
Bonnie",5
"this is the only magazine i buy, and it never leaves the bathroom, i love all the reviews and exclusives. i am happy of the buy great price you save about 100 dollars 5/5 stars",5
I paid for this subscription on August 8 and as of September 11 still have not received. It should not take over a month to get a magazine script started!!,1
"Ordered this in May, it's almost September, still no magazine.  This appears to be a trend per the other comments, Amazon needs to step in.",1
"Idk i find myself not looking through these magazines anymore. They're kind of boring. I tend to read gamepro more often than not. But hey, the demo cds are a plus.",3
"I ordered this June 2nd, and now over 2 months later I am still waiting and every time I check the delivery date is pushed back more and more. Don't waste your time or money here.",1
We ordered this more than 6 weeks ago and still haven't received it.  I hope it actually comes or I threw $5 out the window.,1
Why request a review on an item that has not been shipped yet. Amazon failed me again!,1
This product is pretty good except for you most likely will never receive your 12th issue. Other than that you get disks of demos every month and pretty good articles.,4
"Well I orderd this magazine January 23rd t is now April 1st and I have not seen one issue. So, I would have to give this produst a 1.",1
One of the best magazines I've ever read. A good mixture of humor and content.,5
Isn't the point of getting this mag for that demo CD?  Why would you want to save 10 bucks not to get the CD?,1
"Best mag ever! Maybe cuz its for the best console ever! its got everything reviews, previews, codes, tons of extra stuff, plus a demo disc! This is a GREAT mag.",5
Do not get this magazine w/out the disk!!!  This is a really great mag but 80% of the reason for getting it is for the disk.  ...,2
"The magazine is ok but the fact that the demo disc is excluded make this a waste, better off getting the subscriptiion direct and receiving the disc.",1
Is that this magazine subscription does NOT include the monthly demo disc. (...),1
It's a great magazine for people who are interested in angels!,5
uplifting stories about angel encounters that will make you feel good everytime you read them.,4
"The magazine is ok, but not nearly as good as Guideposts magazine.",3
I love the down to earth feeling of the stories. Regular people going being lifted up. It's a really uplifting magazine and perfect for any age.,5
"I love Angels on Earth.  It's an inspiring magazine. it is published by Guideposts  and you know if they publish it, it will be good.",5
"Love reading Angels on Earth...
Great true stories, have been reading them for years....
Always gives me a great feeling...",5
"Best magazine ever!  Shows real homes, not just staged rooms.  Great articles.",5
A wonderful magazine if you love decorating and interior design. Read it cover to cover.,5
"There are 2 other English country living type magazines that are much better, but this was the cheapest magazine of the three.",2
"Awesome magazine, fascinating historical articles on a variety of British topics! For an Anglophile, it is a must-have.",5
I can't review what I don't have.  I don't know why but I was informed the subscription will not begin until between Sept. 8 and Oct. 6.  Seems like a long wait to me.,1
"Good  read,beautiful gardens and useful information anyone can use whether you live here or in the UK.

Love the homes and decorating  tips, love english homes.",5
This is truly an unexpected Gem.  I found wonderful ideas on how to decorate my home from this magazine.  Really reminds you that a home is more than four walls and lot of stuff.,5
Beautiful magazine!  Excellent articles and lovely pictures.  I really enjoyed reading about the Bronte sisters' home in the last issue.,5
I love this magazine! So different than others and great for a wide age range. Colorful and fun! There are always fresh faces with great things to say. The interviews are great.,5
"love this edgy, hipster mag....can skew a bit young sometimes, but I love their music suggestions and factory girl feature.",4
"I have not received this product yet, and i purchased it in early december.
I am beginning to get worried.",1
"A good magazine, easy to read and some good recipes. Not sure if I will resubmit another year. Not sure if it is worth the price for what you get.",3
"Great magazine, really bad online experience along with the 800 customer service.",1
I don't know why i kept my subscription as long as I have. This magazine is snooty and full of useless cleaning tips (like anyone who subscribes cleans their own house?).,1
Love this magazine... and you couldn't beat the price!,5
My favorite magazine.  Can't wait to receive it in the mail each month!,5
I felt it had too many advertisements.,3
"...if this is simple, I would hate to see complex.  Aimed only at people making 100K+ per year.  The working class are only allowed to look and wish.  Much like GQ",1
Another one of my absolute favorite magazines that I look forward to getting every month.,5
Nothing useful or interesting and I never ordered it but charged on my account.,1
One of my very favorite magazines!!  I love getting this in hard copy.,5
Love this magazine. Good price for the subscription.,5
love the magazine,5
Some good articles--too much filler for my preference.,3
Best articles I've found in a magazine!,5
"Lot's of useful information inside, but also a lot of ads. I bought this at a great price and enjoy reading it while my husband watches his own thing on tv.",4
More advertisements than articles.,2
mostly advertisment. boring stuff. very few new ideas for reusing things...,2
"I never ordered this or any other magazine. Necessitating changing our Credit Card #, because our credit had been compromised.",1
This magazine is about 80% advertising with very little actual articles. Very disappointed,1
Content not worth the price. Bad customer service,1
"too many ads, not enough useful information.  Its changed in the last few years from helpful DIY tips/life hacks to commercial driven.  I will not renew my subscription.",2
Love being able to get my magazine on my Kindle...,5
I used to love this magazine when it first came out. Now it takes me about 5 minutes to flip through it because so much of the content is a joke.,2
"Like a lot of the features, the layout & beautiful photography. Food features are sometimes have bizarre ingredients.",4
I subscribe to the magazine but I'm using fire version for the first time and I'm very disappointed with the low quality images.,1
"Great tips and life hacks, but there are too many ads",4
Way too many ads not much content,2
Great tips and life hacks. Mainly geared towards women. A bunch of Ads. Gotta dig for the nuggets of golden information.,4
Used to buy this magazine years ago and loved all the tips. Unfortunately now instead of a lot of great ideas it is mostly advertisements.,2
Great magazine! Great ideas in every issue!,5
"We got a great deal on this magazine for Black Friday, $5 for a year! My wife loves this magazine.",5
"Ad, ad, and ad...nothing interesting. Is a waste of time...",1
"I love this magazine..I look forward to receiving it every month...Lots of good articles, useful tips and really helpful material.",5
Great magazine at a great price!,5
best price ever,5
"I love, love, love, this magazine!!",5
"Kind of blah this month, hope it gets better...",3
the first Issue was ok I hope the rest are better,3
"So far I have received 2 issues, 1 in April and 1 in December. I'm not sure where the other issues have gone, but they didn't go to my house.",1
Does not seem to be my type magazine.,2
Lots of wonderful ideas and recipes.,5
Great magazine with so many useful tips and ideas!,5

"I ordered Sports Illustrated Kids on 7/12, as of 8/31 have not received first issue, son keeps asking when it will come..",1
I don't know why I was asked to review an item I have not yet received.  I oredered the magazine in July (over a month ago) and my son has not received the first issue yet.,1
This is a very good publication.  I gave it as a gift subscription to my grandson.  Purchasing through Amazon was easy and they followed through.,4

My son was thrilled with his first magazine and we look forward to next month's delivery.,4

We haven't received yet.  I think 1 month should be a time limit on getting an item like this.,1
My first issue arrived. There are a lot of good articles and I know I will be looking forward to each issue.,4
I'm still waiting to see my first copy. What a disappointment as I really wanted to read the January issue!,1
i LOVE real simple!  i look forward to it every month...it is truly my favorite magazine!,5
My sons love this book.  Usually they sit right down by the mailbox and read it.  There are baseball sized cards in it every month and a poster.  Perfect age-appropriate material.,5
"It was easy to do, but I wish an acknowledgment would be sent by the company which receives it in the end.",3
"I love it when my Real Simple magazine arrives in the mail. It is full of great ideas for cooking, organizing, fashion and crafts.",5

Nothing really  iin it,1
This is my favorite magazine. Ive been subscribing for over 10 years. Always relevant and helpful articles.,5

Magazine has gone to political. Love the financial & yravelmadvise though!,3
"Liberal Rag, nothing helpful to speak of",1
"I find the magazine very transparent, of very little content.",1
Great value for a quality magazine,4
The Kindle version did not work well at all you could not read individual stories it was if you were reading a giant PDF.,1
Good Deal!,4
Don't remember signing up for this or I thought it was paper instead of electronic,1
I used to like Smart Money magazine a lot but they discontinued Smart Money. So you have only Money and Kiplingers now. This is a good mag for beginners and as a reference.,4

Lower price than even through Money direct. Best way to renew and it works for both personal and gift subscriptions!,5
Haven't seen a copy of the magazine yet??  Soon I hope or I'll ask for my money back. Any ideas on where it is or when it will show up?,1

Happy with print and fire editions. Lots of good ideas and inspiration,4

Still a good mag. For inspiration,4
not for me,1

"The style is gorgeous!, Simple, bright and with  good ideas on it. You may want  to try it. You will want more",4
I just didn't enjoy this very much. There wasn't really anything new about it. I prefer other magazines of this genre.,3
Can't really review-was never able to fully load it on Kindle-finally gave up. That is all I have to say -but this system needs 7 more words til I can submit review.,1
"this magazine has many great idea's.  I get it on my kindle, and it reads very well - I like the fact that I can blow up the photos",4

Some of the topics / articles don't relate to a 10 year old (4th grader going into 5th grade),3

This one is a big hit with both MOM and DAUGHTER (age 11)  She loves it!  I love it!  SCORE!!!!,5

This has been my 11 yr. old daughter's FAVORITE magazine for years.  She absolutely loves it!  She learns something new (and cool) from every issue.,5

subscribed to this despite multiple negative reviews. should have heard to those. there are enough feedback and NG should address it. i am already looking for alternative options.,2
never buy this product ever.  waste of money.  very bad customer experience.  i will tell all of my friends not to buy this product.,1
love ng and looked at kids version. i was disgusted. is it ok to produce high value for adults and garbage for kids? won't renew my ng because i am so disappointed.,1
"Ads, ads, and more ads.  Sigh. National Geographic used to be a cut above the rest.  Sadly, they are in the same category as SpongeBob Squarepants now.",1
Full of shoe and video game ads.  Not much content.  Content is low quality.,1
It will be a huge disappointment if you are expecting the quality of a National Geographic. The thin content is hardly beneficial to kids. NOT RECOMMENDED.,1
I love this magazine!  So wonderful and educational for kids! Who am I kidding?  The adults love it too!,5
This is a very good magazine. My 7 year old son loves it. Ordered online and have received once.,4
i cant review it cause im still waiting to  see my first issue. I had already forgot about it.,1
"Very little good content.  Not worth it, needs serious help.  Can't believe that a name like National Geographic would be behind such junk.",1
"If you'd prefer your child not be sold-to on every page, then don't bother with this magazine. What a disappointment. Shame on National Geographic.",1
"Ads, ads, ads. Movie tie-ins. Product placement. Is there anything here about real people, places, animals? Don't bother looking.",1
Don't even bother getting this. It is like reading one big ad to your children.,1
"FULL of ads, hardly any content at all. Not worth paying for it.",1
It's been over a month since I paid for the subscription and I still haven't seen any sign of a magazine yet.  <sigh>,1
"This magazine has a ridiculous amount of advertising, much of which they try and pull off as articles.  Big Backyard or Ladybug are much better choices for young kids.",2
she loves this magazine,5
love it.  and delivered as promised!,5
"LOVE this magazine! Great for beginner and intermediate gardeners. Excellent, useful advice and beautiful photos.",5
Nice magazine and has lots of pictures and helpful info  I'm glad I found it.,4

It's almost like getting a book because it's so artfully laid out. It's definitely something I will save after I read.,4
Mother absolutely loves this magazine and wishes she could move back to AZ,5
"Dear Sir or Madam,
I have not recieved this item. Please advise. The item was paid for but not recieved.
Sarah Mings",1
We love this magazine.  We do the road trips and have seen some great areas and scenery.  The magazine helps to give us great places to explore.,5
The prior issues had more information on a longer span of year models. Was once the best guide. Now it is not maintained well.,3
There weren't very many short stories which interested me.  I cancelled my subscription.,2
Ilike this book because it has several short very good stories. You can read it at different times.,4
"This is still a good magazine for mystery lovers. I particularly like the new columns. The stories are varied; some I loved, some I didn't and I'm sure it's just my taste.",4
print was too small and I was unable to use Kindle feature to enlarge it.  Was unable to read it.,1
"Really enjoy the magazine, nice quick read when you don't have a lot of time.  Anybody who likes mysteries will enjoy.",4
I just got the iPad version of EQMM. For some reason the table of contents only fills have the iPad page. The actual stories do take up the full page. What's up?,1
"like the hobby itself it has declined.  Articles are fair, plenty of ads but not what it used to be.  Too bad.",3
"What a disappointment; don't waste your money, as it's 90% ads.  A shadow of the 1980's/90's publication.  Two thumbs down :(",1
The best of the best.. Always exciting stories...,5
Love the Kindle version!,5
"A few stories are riceless, most are good and a very few are bombs; overall the mix is enjoyable.  In addition they are just the right lentgth to read in one sitting.",4
You charged me for this - and I want it - yet I still have not started receiving it. Either provide me with a subscription or refund my money.,1
I really would like to review this item but I still haven't received it!,1
"Order the mag, Never came, I called Amazon, Never got it, Over a year now. Never heard a word about it.......sorry to say..........",1
I doubt you will publish my review since I have not received a single copy after several months.  I will be very reluctant to buy again.,1
This is a very informative magazine that I can send to my nephew who collects coins and valuable currency.,4
great magazine for knife collectors!!!!  if you really really like/love to collect knives - this is a mandatory subscription,5
"It never downloaded, so I cancelled the subscription.  Too bad. The cover looked nice though.",1
I like the stores and pictures of the new knives.,4
Sometimes too many ads.,3
One of the best publications for knife enthusiast !,5
"good magazine, great list of upcoming knife shows, too many ad's.  wish they would focus a bit more on 2 makers per issue",4
Very informative with pics and interviews of knife makers and collectors as well! Worth the money! If you like knives you will like this Magazine!!,4
"Fantastic magazine, look forward to it every Friday, lots of great articles, upcoming sales and auctions, lots of useful information, very interesting and entertaining.",5
Junk. Ordered for my dad who is a huge car enthusiast and restores old cars. He returned it saying it's a bunch of ads and nothing relevant. WASTE of money - don't buy.,1
"pulp paper, low content, overloaded with ads",1
This magazine sucks!  Dont waste your money,1
Great to have D&DH at my finger tips no matter where I am. Easy to navigate too!,5
Completely product driven.,1
The best hunting magazine published! Good magazine for all deer hunters.,5
"Even though I'm Australian and our deer species are different the fundamentals are the same, this magazine is a must read",4
Best North American deer hunting and hunting gear magazine on the market!,5

Love these,5
Love this magazines,5
Their business isn't cooking but rather taking advantage of laws allowing them to charge for nothing. Their management model is excrement.,1
"I've loved t
His Mag. for years!",4
I love this magazine!  No ads or nonsense - just tips and recipes. I've made several of the recipes without any challenges!,5
I always enjoyed this magazine and very happy to have it available to read on my Kindle Fire.  Anyone who likes the how and why of recipes will enjoy this magazine.,5
"This was what my niece requested for Christmas, and she was very specific about this magazine. I trust she is pleased.",4
I never received the magizine  and this has been the second time that this has happened once with the magizine and once with a book .,1
This is one of the best cooking resources that I have found.  If you love to cook and not just follow a recipe then you must try this magazine.,5
"They charged my credit card, but to this date they have not notified the recipient that she would be receiving the magazine. This is very upsetting.",1
They are scam artist. They will send you the book and it does not matter if you ordered it.  And charge you.  Buyer beware!,1
Cooks Illustrated is an excellent cooking magazine.  I've cooked my whole life and find new things to try every issue.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.,5
Very interesting reading but recipes were a little too complicated for me and I didn't get very good result when I tried them. I need something quicker to use.,3
If you are a Michelin chef might be good for you - otherwise a bit boring and serious - but well defined set of a few recipes and suggestions.,3
"Wonderful accurate information on food, utensiles, products, etc.  Great information about culinary treats and practices.  Superb magazine.  Every cook should read this.",5
"What a great magazine! The illustrations are easier to follow than photos, the recipes are great. Love it!",5
I ordered this May 8 and have still not received a copy nor any acknowledgement of the order except from Amazon.,1
"I would suggest his for any child

My 11 year old daughter loved this magazine.  I've just renewed her subscription.  Its a great purchase.,5
Purchased for an 8 year old. It's perfect for him. Loves the articles and pictures. He's even written in to one of the author's.,5
Can't go wrong. it is awesome magazine!,5
I ordered this magazine for my 10 year old grandson.  He loves it!,5
Boring...can't think of anything else to say.  Just not interesting enough to keep on reading it.  Was for a boy who is very smart.,1
"The issue would not download to Kindle, even after hours spent with two different customer service representatives working on the problem.",1
Muse is the best kid's magazine ever.  I will still be subscribing for myself when all my munchkins are grown and gone.,5
too expensive and the service is not good,1
Needs more content for the price.,3
Subscribed for my great grandson and he loves it.  llustrations are wonderful.,5
High Quality magazine.  Nine year old likes it a lot.,4
Excellent publication. My kids love reading it. Very well written and excellent varied topics. I highly recommend it for kids who are learning to read.,5
"Not sure what the deal is, but they didn't like it.  Also they said it had lots of ads!?  Not worth the money.",2
"This is a wonderfully written, interesting magazine that my kids absolutely love. We're science buffs in my family. It's perfect.",5
Not enough content to justify price.,2
Our 8-YO grandson really enjoys this magazine.  I just renewed it for another year.  Well worth the subscription price!,5
This was a gift for my kids and we got it for their cousin. Fantastic magazine. Great images and beautiful age appropriate poetry.,5
great for my nieces that are 2.... they have loved it,5
Cute...thought it would be longer with more stories...only 10 pages or so.,3
letters in kindle are to hard to see even after it was enlarge therefore really hard to enjoy its content,3
Helpful magazine.,4
This magazine is an excellent way to escape the madness of our daily news. Photographs are excellent,5
Good publication,4
"Neither the pictures nor the advice is all that great.  I'm a professional wildlife photographer, and I haven't learned anything new.",3
"Takes a few months for delivery, but always liked the magazine.",4
First copy and so far enjoyable.,4

This is my favorite photography magazine.,5
The first issue non black and white photography was interesting and I will apply the ideas to my work.,4
"Excellent coverage of gear, techniques, places, software, etc. And the digital edition is great on my nook using tube Amazon app.",5
"It's an okay magazine for $11.00 bucks/a year. I wouldn't pay more for it. Loaded with ads, as most magazines are anymore.",3
"I bought this as a gift for my brother, a budding outdoor photog, and he says he enjoys it. I have bought a renewal because he said he enjoyed it.",4
Fantastic magazine and highly recommend it for all nature photographers just starting out as well as for those with experience.,5
I have learned something from every issue and this is my 3rd year of reading this mag. I highly recoment it,5
Have been subscribing to this magazine for about 12 years..Lots of good tech and practical information..I re-upped with this time with Amazon for less $$$'s,4
I look forward to receiving this magazine every month because it contains great technical tips and locations for landscape photography.,5
"Each month my son and I peruse and read this magazine of beauty and creativity. For lovers of nature and photography, this is the right magazine.",4
"terrible service, i contacted customer service and then only recieved 1 issuethen nothing so i say buyer beware, subscibe at your own risk",1
I am new to digital photography and am really learning a lot just reading this mag.  Took a while to receive my first one but well worth the wait.,4
"The American Scholar is the magazine I've always wanted. Superb essays, superb poetry. My thanks to Anne Fadiman.",5
Love this magazine. Lots of great info for the beginner bee keepers and lots of info for more advanced people. My grandpa liked it so much I got him a gift subscription this year.,5
Read from cover to cover !,5
An absolute MUST HAVE for anyone raising bees or simply wanting insure their suvival to so we don't run out of food!,5
"Interesting articles, lots of beautiful images, and easy to access resources. A great addition to any studio or home reading collection.",4
Not as I expected,2
Not a craft mag. All about buying crafts. Filled with ads for pricey crafts that only the rich can afford,1
I love the content of this mag and can't wait for every issue to come ...you'll love it too...try it..,5
"Great articles, just wish the mag was a bit thicker....",4
"One of my favorites. A must have in any shooters bathroom collection!

Hands down the best of the bunch.,5
I have read this in hard copy for many years and will continue to read F&SF on Kindle! Love it!,5
Awesome magazine glad to receive it digitally!  Yay!,5

"This will only allow you to view 2 magazines at a time on your device, the rest are stored in the cloud....the app was better....",3
I love the video clips that come with the Kindle edition.  It puts a new spin on one of my favorite magazines.,5
THE BEST CAR MAGAZINE GOING!! ALWAYS GREAT PICTURES AND WELL WRITTEN HONEST AND PRECISE ARTICLES AND THE REVIEWS ARE SOME OF THE BEST AROUND!!,5
I ordered in December and it's going to arrive in march.......  that's kinda long don't you think? maybe you guys should speed it up a bit?,1
Great Magazine! Been subscribing to it for years.  One of the best magazines I've read in a long time.  Great!,5
I've been reading this magazine for years and its getting better and better every year! I love it every time!,5
I enjoyed this magazine some. But have let it run out. I drive cars to get places and their reviews don't relate to how I feel about cars.,3
you better watch out for their auto subscribe. They send you magazine and charge you premium. stay away and beware!,1
Love this magazine and it's so much more convenient on my kindle! It works perfectly and I never have any issues!,5
This and Road and Track are the two best consumer automotive magazines. Great information and the articles are top notch.,5
"Great layout, very good articles and talented writers. I enjoy each issue. Will probably continue with subscription.  Thanks for the great magazine!",4
the articles did not completely satisfy me. I did like the easy purchase from Amazon and quickness of loading on my kindle.,3
hubster loves this magazine and has been receiving it for the last twenty plus years.  a necessary read in our house,5
It's a good car magazine and I got it as a test for myself using the Kindle - what do you mean 3 more words required?.,4
Some issues come - some don't. Not again. I would not recommend ordering magazines until improvements are made. Only product I have ordered the has not been satisfactory.,2
"good mag. nice articles and enjoy seeing the new things that are coming out.
nice articles on long term test of new cars",4
I love every time i get this magazine in the mail!  Fantastic Reviews!  It is always shipped right on time!,5
"Great price, great magazine.",5
I stopped getting this magazine about 3 years ago. Decided I wanted it again since the price was right the magazine is horrible now. I am sorry I got it again.,1
I wish there wasn't as many ads but still great reviews on cars and all kinds of new cars coming out.,4
I tried to get my address changed and nobody has answered me yet. I was displaced because of the hurricane.,1
I ordered the magazine because I'm thinking about buying a new car. Mostly I enjoy reading the reviews and seeing pics of latest model cars. It definitely fills the bill.,4
I haven't received a single issue yet.  I hope my subscription  does NOT begin with last month's issue or even two old issues.  That's happened to me before.,1
I bought a 12 month subscription through an Amazon offer that costs me less than the price of a single magazine;I can't think of a better deal I've ever had.,4
I am still waiting for my first issue. It has been paid for but this review request reminds me that I am still waiting.,1
My grandmother is an artist. Last two years I am giving this magazine as a Christmas gift for her. She loves it a lot!!!,5
International artist is the best art magazine going.  An absolute must have for anyone with any art interests.,5
Do not pay for this!!!! I only got 2 or 3 magazines the entire time!! Such a waste of money!!!,1
I didn't get the first two issues,1
"Zero star, i received damage magazine for all 4 issues. No more
Again and again. I have to request for good condition for every issue. Very disappoint.",1
There's such a large emphasis on wedding dresses. The magazine is pretty much just pictures of dresses. I subscribed to 2 wedding magazines and they're both really disappointing.,2
"Nice magazine
Car seat returned because it was a duplicate",3
Used to be a great magazine. Then they had to insert themselves in to the presidential campaign. Idiots!,1
Best magazine in the English language.,5
This is the absolute best wedding magazine hands down. It has you completely covered from style to venues to creative bouquets to great food and great DIY ideas.,5
Was not able to download to any of my five devices?,1
Really great mix of ideas and inspiration - but a few too many dress advertisements - would rather see more styling inspiration,4
I fell asleep twice.  That's enough for me not to order it,1
"This has been a great help for my daughters wedding coming up.  I just love this, because we can see what is the latest and what we are thinking of doing?",5
I enjoyed reading the articles in this magazine. Ordering the online version was so much cheaper than buying the print version but I miss being able to tear out pages.,4
I'm a wedding photographer who loves finding new inspiration for my future events. Martha Stewart weddings has some of the best visuals I've seen by far.,5
"I like this magazine.  It's kind of pricey and has far too many ads, but.....all in all it's a pretty good magazine.  I especially like the articles and pictures on real weddings.",4
Very up to date news and opinion. I read about issues before the television news groups report them. Very informative.,4
One of the most important magazines you could ever own. So useful and insightful. Love it.,5
always great ideas. Love chesamerica@gmail.com,5
Amazon did a pathetic job to a fantastic magazine. The Kindle edition is hardly readable.,1
Brought it and most of the things are not related really regret buy it,1
This was a renewal; not a first time purchase.  I have not received any magazines to date.  I renewed on 2-12-08.....,1
"I think the title says it all.

I renew using Amazon... no magazine yet.",1
I can not tell a page of advertisement from a page of an article!,1
This quilting magazine is filled with wonderful ideas.  The colors choices are great and you have a choice of easy to hard quilts.  I love the magazine.,5
I didn't buy this piece of crap!,1
I don't think that the magazine suits the Kindle layout. There is also alot of ads which make the process of reading it harder.,3
Best quilting mag anywhere,5
"Changes format, fewer pages and all quilts are made with big chunks of fabric.",1
Enjoy it every month,4
Not quite the magazine it used to be but still very informative,4
A good look at cars and trucks.. foreign and domestic. It also reports on trends and influences on the industry.,4
I got this subscription for my Mom for her birthday.  She quilts daily and loves the magazine.,5
The McCall's Quilting magazine is my favorite quilting magazine.  The articles contain variety and the patterns and quilt information are easy to understand and plentiful,5
I'm not a quilter but my daughter loves it and asks to have it renewed each year. A nice gift that gives all year.,4
"very well written, very insightful and informative",4
"For a magazine that is supposed to be cutting edge, it has one of the worst Kindle experiences out there.  I may as well be reading a PDF.",1
Love Fast Company content. But impossible to read on the Kindle Fire. Any ideas that would make it more readable -- like the 'print view' in NYT.,2
If you love cars then you can't go wrong with this subscription!,5
I have not received a print or digital copy of the magazine yet.,1
MY 92 YEAR OLD BROTHER LOVES THIS MAGAZINE,5
good book,4
"Well written articles, good start up info as well as articles on established businesses.",4
it won't open. it says that its on another device.. this is the only kindle i own. DONT PURCHASE.IT DOES NOT WORK.,1
Great magazine for a very low price,4
I cannot believe the only way  too order these is on  a kindle(your loss) I was going to order more than one subscription.,1
Great over priced,4
"Bought 3 years magazine subscription by written check, they only give me 1 year and ask me renew today, What fraud, never again",1
Nice format and I like the fact that they review companies with different sizes. You get a chance to look at all sorts of companies and managing styles.,4
The info is good and the issue out earlier than the news stand.,4
"Ordered as a gift.  The order process was confulsing, and never reached the recipient.  I'm sure the magazine itself is great.",3
"The best car magazine on the market today.  I have subscribed for eight years. Great website too!
Covers everything from a $17,000 car to a $2,000,000 car.",5
This magazine has been viewed by inmates and has been truly enjoyed.  thanks to you I can afford to send it to our friends,5
"But, on Kindle, it's hard to read and navigate. Guess I'm just an old guy who likes to turn the pages.",3
Good business stories with a tech focus.  Not as good as Wired but still a quality pub.,4
Ordered this magazine two months ago and as  yet have not received one copy.,1
"I have gotten every other magazine that I subscribed to except Fast Company
What's up?",1
"I love True Story.  I have loved this material for many years, and was very happy to be able to purchase it once again.",5
"Good mag, but not great like Automobile magazine.  A little rah-rah for my tastes, but does a good job covering some excellent European cars.",3
Awesome magazine with actual true stories.  They are heartwarming and interesting.  Have been a loyal reader for a very long time.  Keep renewing my subscription.  A must have.,5
One of my Mom's favorite for years...,5
I renew this every year for my dad for his birthday. He's building a 32' Ford from scratch. This is his favorite mag!,5
Ok magazine. It has lots of information regarding new bikes. Not much regarding older bikes or mechanics.,3
My husband loved the magazine.,5
"Bad content, too many adds and they don't send one per month, it's more like three in two weeks then the following 9 asap...",1
Best dike book in the world !!!!,5
"Never got this on My Kindle fire, did not download. It did work on our I-Pad mini.",1
"If you ""must"" ride (as I must) then you ""must"" read Cycle World and it's ilk.",5
I renew every year.  Always enjoy reading!,4

great mag covering a wide variety of bikes.,4
"Always liked this magazine. Used to get the hardcopy, but now I have a kindle so I get cycle world electronically.",4
Hubby likes it.,4
"Great magazine, good tips and tricks that you can apply to every day riding.",4
Perfect gift for my boyfriend glad I spotted it and bought it before the issue came out he loves it,5
"When I am not being made aware that there is an automatic renewal of my subscription it makes me feel like being taken advantage of,a feeling not really positive",1
"Really good articles, written by who actually ride motorcycles.
Not a collection of paid articles from bike makers, who wants to advertise their products.",4
My husband loves this magazine and gets excited every time he gets one thru the mail!  So glad I ordered it!,5
Always great articles and very informative. I will be a subscriber for years to come. The pictures are very cool also....,5
Got my TWO issues today- don't appreciate getting the current one and last months' at the same time. It's like getting 11 issues for the price of 12.,1
Good gun mag to keep up with the latest,4
Good articles and content,4
I have received only ONE magazine since ordering in JUNE!!!!!!  I have written numerous emails to integrated Media and Amazon and NOTHING has been done!!!!,1
G&A and Firearms News seem to have morphed into very similar publications. Doesn't make sense to pay for both.,2
"Good magazine, would have been 5 stars if were more articles and less advertisements.",4
Got this for my Dad and he said he loves getting it every month!,5
Read from cover to cover each month. Great articles for gun lovers from beginner to expert.,5

My husband was thrilled to receive this as a Christmas gift this year....he loves his 2nd amendment rights ;),5
One of the best knitting magazines,5
I always look forward to reading  this magazine and to get inspired by the pieces that you offer. Mag girl from Tucson.,5
"Being a traditional quilter, the so-called new ""fabric and pattern choices"" does not quite appeal to me.  Neither does the many small project designs.",3
Quiltmaker has always been a great magazine - chalk full of beautifully made quilts and information about the quilter.  Beautiful magazine as always.,5
I am subscribed to interweave craft daily but cannot access my account.i have sent a number of messages but have not received any answers.help!,1
Great to read,4
I've always liked this magazine.  I am not a fantastic knitter but like to dream about projects as I enjoy magazine.,4
"I really don't think any other knitting magazines aside from IK are worth buying. It's beautiful quality with a nice mix of articles and patterns, and really good value for money.",4
I always look forward to getting each issue.  There are great patterns and I always find a new project. Also very helpful with knitting tips.,5
"I never received it, giving it any stars is sort of pointless. Likewise I really don't see much point in being required to write 20 words for a product I have never seen.",1
"I love this magazine, plenty of updated classic styles as well as some new fashion forward styles, takes your knitting from afghans and scarves into great wardrobe items!",5
Subscribed for years and always interesting read,4

I love WWII history  for each american killed there were 40 or more Russians killed.,5
THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF! THEY DIDN'T EVEN SEND THE MAGAZINE & IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GIFT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.,1
A bird man's delight. Best periodical on this subject,5
Okay Magazine. But because I am no longer a Prime Member it's no longer free.,3
Great magazine at an unbeatable Amazon subscription price. A great magazine for all pilots and aviation enthusiasts.,5
As a ww2 fighter pilot I love this magazine. Good subscription price Through Amazon.,5
The best WWII Mag out there bar none,5
"Shipping errors!  Good mag, but I only got a fee copies.",3
"Plan and simple, I love the magazine.",5
I can't really say. It so long for the first issue to arrive that I cancelled my subscription. I never got to read one so I'll say it's OK.,3
This is my husbands favorite magazine. Every Christmas I renew it for him as a gift. It's like getting a gift every month...,5
The magazine is great. Don't use auto-renewal. You pay full retail cover price. Wait for a deal and you can get three subscriptions for the same prive.,2
Must read!,5
"Mainly advertisements, alright, not all that I was looking for.",3
You like guns? get this! so many great articles and new weapons coming out all the time.,5

"I have yet to receive any issue or information on this magazine, will soon be contacting them directly, i think i have gave them enough leeway.",1
"Lots of useful, current information, but somewhat rambling. Overall a very good source of information. This magazine appears to be for the very knowledgable gun person.",4
I ordered this as a stocking stuffer for the boyfriend and he loves it! Looks forward to it coming every month!,5
Sent it to my son. He really enjoyed the articles. Still waiting for another one to arrive.,4
I have the same problem as the other customers.  Never received my magazines even after calling them twice. STAY OUT OF THIS SELLER!,1
This magazine has a worth of knowledge and reads very well on my Kindle Fire. I plan on purchasing a subscription.,4

"Read it. Live it. Love it.  100 million plus strong, and behind every blade of grass.  Long live the republic.",5
Love it. Just as I remember.,5
After a recent article promoting gun control by Dick Metcalf I have canceled my subscription. They have really let us down. I feel so betrayed words cannot describe it.,1
Wish there was some way to link my existing account so i can make that bread on the go! Oh well.,1
So expensive.just buy don't build,1
This is garbage I don't know one company that takes two months to deliver. I'm sorry this is unacceptable. what a waste.,1

My husband's magazine gift subscription. It is a good deal for the renewal. He is all set for another year!,4
I haven't received it . Not very good service from you guys . probably won't make that mistake again .,1
I've been reading this magazine for 20 years now and it's always loaded with excellent and timely articles. Definitely the best of the best.,5
"One of the best gun mags ever published, contains a good cross section of various types of firearms and shooting accessories.",5
I learn something with every issue.,5

I want the large print not small but love the story in it. John Bradford,3
this publication has changed. I'm 75 and remember a chock full weeks read,3

to much advertisments,2

"Too many ads, not enough actual travel articles. The pictures are gorgeous though.",3

"Beautiful, wonderful magazine for the traveler or the armchair traveler. It's from National Geographic, so you know it's gorgeous. Highly recommend. Delightful magazine!",5
Purchased this to read the article on great summer trips.  I was disappointed with their selections.,1
One small sized magazine filled with advertisements.  Avoid.,1
Easy and relaxing to read and covers many different parts of the world but not in enough depth.,4
Always a treat to find the new copy in the mailbox.,4

RD is still the most readable and informative magazine anywhere.  Regular delivery,5

A great publication. Enough said !,5
"My prime reading is worthless to me since I can only download to my Kindle.  Also, it would not open on my Kindle.  Boo.  Hiss.",1
Very irritating that this e magazine is unable to download to an iPad.,1
A great price.  Reader's Digest never disappoints. I have been enjoying it for over 30 years.,5
Can't wait for it to get here every month!,5
Not nearly as good as it used to be.  I would say it has about half the content it once had.,3

Love ESPN!,5

"Pro: Was only $5 for a year.

Con:  Not family friendly enough for a waiting room in my opinion and too much liberal clap trap.",3
"To big and no one at my house reads it, my husband takes it to work and gives it away",1
Not like old RD- now has lots of lightweight original content. Sort of a disappointment- but it's my link to what got me started reading when I was little.,3
Why is it soooooo big??  Good articles though.,4
I am very happy to subscribe to Readers Digest again- great price,5
I LOVE RD!,5
Love this for quick reading. My sons have always loved to read these. Always has interesting stories & funny jokes. Love Reader's Digest!,5

good deal -,4
It's interesting,4

"I couldn't believe Amazon sold Readers Digest! And ""The Price Was Right""!!!
Thank You for all your wonderful assortment of merchandise!",5
"i would give lower if possible.........try to cancel the auto-renewing subscription

I will try to avoid watching the tv show now",1
worst mag i ever sub'ed to. all ad's and stuff i don't care about!,1
Love Readers Digest as always. However my first issue was very late in arriving.,4
"It takes almost 10 weeks for this to activate which is a long time. I was advised end of June.
Excellent price if you can wait that long.",2
"This sounds like a great deal for the cost, but I have not received one magazine.  Hope to see them soon!",1
I have not yet started to receive the magazine.  Should I be?  What's the problem?,1
"The iOS app was very disappointing and that was how I wanted to read the magazine.  The print edition is good, albeit oversized.",2
"so, i stopped my subscription and give to my guy friends. they love it, too. when time permits i borrow their copy without feeling like i am wasting my money.",4
It's not like it used to be back 20 years ago. I only got one issue and found it uninteresting,1
"ESPN tries hard, too hard.  This publication is a big disappointment and NEVER agree to auto-renewal because it is a giant rip-off.",1
"I did not agree to auto renewal, and when made aware of the gimmick, it was very difficult to undo.  Dumb policy and bad process.",1
I did not know I was signing up for auto-renewal and do not want the magazine anymore or the auto-renewal.  This was very misleading and I am not happy about it.,1
"First off, I bought a 1yr subscription & only received 4-5 magazines.  Absolute joke.  Very disappointed and refuse to read this magazine ever again.",1
Great deal! Mom loves it!,5
"I got this mag for the man in my life thinking it was about sports. But with this cover I'm not happy. If ur a porn mag, say so. Don't cover it up. Be truthful in advertising.",1
"My favorite magazine of all time ..
thank you",5
"this was a fathers day gift... guess he likes it and enjoys the fact, articles and pictures! Would recommend to anyone",4
This book contains tooooo much ads. even the ads. is more than the articles. I really do not like this. I think is must why it is that cheap.,2
too much glitz and ads...not enough score and articles! put in all scored from the previous month. glad i only paid 5 bucks for this script!,3
Love readers digest. The perfect mix of humor and information.,5
ESPN will make you put in a credit card number to get access to the insider service even after you get your first magazine.,1
I got this subscription for my husband since he's such a sports buff but its pretty much the same as the channel.,3
I think this was my oops.... it took forever for first one to arrive....although I think it was stated....,3
My son loves this magazine!  He looks forward to each issue. ESPN is a great magaine for men. Keep up the good articles!!!,5
"for some reason i was subscribed to it, i tried to unsubscribe and it didn't work at all. but oh well",2
Even though this item promises to renew your current subscription you will still be charged by ESPN. I'm still trying to get my money back.,1
"Only reason to buy this is the insider access on ESPN.com.  This goes straight in the trash.  If you have to read it, take some aspirin!",1
"Since 'way back when', I have always always read it cover to cover. Never a disappointment!",5
I cannot provide a good rating as this still has not been received.  I would like to expedite this process to receive these issues ASAP.,1
He enjoys this...  it is like the old holiday 'Sears 'catalog.  loots to dream about .  Not alot of practical info though,4
Love it !!!!,5
I like this magazine,4
Good magazine if you like sailing.,4
I love this magazine. It has great articles for both new and seasoned sailors. The publication also often features great reviews.,5
very good photos- limited content spread over huge variety of sports.  Shows difficulty print has in focusing content.  Where do you go after reading the one article on baseball?,3
"This has got to be the worst sports magazine out there. The articles aren't worth reading. Avoid this magazine, even if it was free!",1
The best car magazine available.,5
This was a great deal.  I purchased the magazine subscription around Thanksgiving and the first copy was delivered before Christmas.,5
"I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and we both love it! I am very happy with the purchase!",5
The mighty days for this publication are now clearly behind them. Get a digital version or read online for free most of the articles. Mostly 5-page weathertech floor mat ads now.,2
"Road and Track ain't what it used to be, just like Car and Driver.  It was cheap and I glance through it while spending time in the reading room.  Not many good writers anymore.",3
Have not been receiving regular delivery of subscription.,1
Stop charging me,1
Way better than Car and Driver magazine!,5
Always have issues with wrong mag being delivered to Kindle good luck getting corrected,1
This month's (Sep issue) Kindle Road & Track has been  supplanted by an issue of Seventeen magazine.,1
I expected more but it's ok.,3
The best monthly car magazine out there. Way less typos than Automobile or Car and Driver.,5
"My 13 year old granddaughter enjoyed the magazine. Unfortunately, she lives in another State and we haven't discussed the magazine after the first issue.",4
exactly as expected.,4
"I think its a real good magazine, if I compare with Shutterbug",4
Have read Readers Digest for years...great stories & articles in a condensed formula.,5
"I love readers digest, what can I say",5
very interesting magazine if like motorsports,4
we love it!,5
"After a hiatus, I subscribed again to American Photo.  The writing and printing are poor quality.  Not the magazine it used to be.",1
gave as a gift to Mr Wonderful...he sezs lots of useful information inside and well worth the price,5
one should have the opportunity to accept or reject 'auto renewal',1
"Not as good as Car and Driver and Motor Trend, but good enough to read if you are free and have nothing to do.",3
Great deal on a Great magazine!,5
Wow.  I received my first issue. Little to no content. Find a charity and donate the cost of this subscription.  You'll feel much better.,1
"I love this magazine.  Many interesting articles, very informative, and always good laughs..  A+",5
"Ordered as a gift for someone,they like this monthly mag",4
"When I renewed, I was told that I would not get deplucants.
I was mailed both old issues, May  and June .
Not happy.",1
Wished I'd known it was only six issues a year. Better coverage and reading in Pop Photo. Or Petersen's. Or the newspaper.,3
Informative. Not as relevant to me as Dressage Today.,3
"Too many adds, I won't be renewing.",3
My daughter LOVES this and gets so excited every time it comes in the mail!! I love that she is getting a magazine the she likes with a Christian focus! Everyone is happy!!,5
Love this magazine and size. We read and then put them in the Airbnb for our guests to enjoy.,5
Great magazine for a great price. I read them cover to cover when they come in. So much better then just getting bills and junk mail. It gives me something to look forward too.,4
My only complaint is this magazine keeps getting smaller and smaller.,4
Just got my first issue. Very pleased. have always loved Readers Digest so very happy to get it at such a great price.,5
"this was a gift so can not say too much about being satisfied or not, but as far as I know the recipient of the gift is satisfied",3
Christmas present for son and grandson.  My favorite motorheads love the magazine so I keep re-subscribing.  The price is unbeatable.,5
This was a gift and I was told they read and love every issue! I have renewed the subscription again!,5
"My family enjoys this magazine and has always been happy with it.  Amazon has made subscriptions easy to renew, wonderful job!",5
Love to see this Classic magazine arrive in the mail box,5
"U CHEAT YOUR CUSTOMERS . NEVER RECEIVED BUT ONE. MAGAZINE. MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.
U PROBABLY SCREW EVERYONE LIKE THAT.

LARRY HUBBARD
RE. LWHUBRD@AOL.COM",1
My daughter loved it and can't wait for her next issue! I will definitely be renewing the subscription next year.,5
only got like 4 issues and thats it never again not happy and i would of liked my money back,1
"A classic, somewhat updated, quick reads, still positive uplifting stories",4
"If you like a little more detail and number crunching comparisons of different cars in the same class,  than R &T is a good car magazine to utilize as referencing the differences.",4
When you want the best in auto news read Road & Track.  Been reading this magazine for over 50 years.,5
"An excellent horse magizine with well written, easy to read articles that cover a vaiety of topics.  I subscribe to three horse related magizines and this is my favorite.",5
My husband is the head of a college Automotive Technology department.  He's read all of the mags put out there for auto enthusiasts and loves this one by far.,5
"I got this for my husband and ordered another magazine at the same time.  The other magazine arrived a couple of weeks ago, but still no Road & Track!  Bummer!",1
Gives the news and reviews I like. Covers the cars I am interested in. Good photos and factual appraisals of cars.,4
You can't go wrong with Reader's Digest.,5

Not as good as it used to be. A lot thinner magazine than before,3
"Gun Dog is a good, but not great, magazine.  Customer support is very poor.",3

"didn't get it/ wasn't received/ it was never mailed to me/ must be on flight 370/
somebody's dog ate it/ was it on the hindenberg?",1

A must have magazine!,5
good mag  with good articles that are written for the average guy who doesn't know every acronym and abbreviation in the industry,4
It is the only magazine that I read cover to cover because I can't put it down!!!!! I love this!!!!!!,5
"Equus is one of my favorite mags! It has great medical information and interesting pictures. Plus, they have an inspiring horse story in each issue.",5
"I agree with the other review, this is loaded with advertising inserts, and nothing much to read.",3
Liberal coverage. Good book and movie reviews. Average price.,3
Time has become a political hate magazine; absolute garbage publication......stay clear of this trash and do not let political hate upset your life.,1
BS Rag Mag!,1
"I have been getting Reader's Digest for years and that that it is available on Kindle, I love it even more.",5
Very good magazine I love it,5
"Great value!  Everyone loves Reader Digest, young and old.",5
Where do I go for help in accessing my improved version? I have tried everything.,1
Boring content; not up to the same standard as other publications available on news stands.,2
This is no longer a good publication,1
86% off? Well you know there a left wing communist socialist pieces of s***,1
Such a one sided magazine. These articles don't provide two views only one from the far left what a shame.,1
Garbage print. Wouldnt know the truth if it jumped up and bit them on the Ass.,1
"Most of the articles would never download.  Just a blank screen that said ""waiting to download.""",1
"Terrible, no longer journalism, just made up stories for shock value. Complete trash.",1
In 10 weeks received only 1 issue ! Cancelled,1
Fake news,1
Would not of signed up for it if I knew the co sold to the rep brothers,1
Not sure when they are coming and when they aren't,3
A very one sided magazine  will not purchase again,1
The liberal media run amok. It's sad that such an iconic periodical has been seized and destroyed by political protagonists.,1
"Subscribed after some excellent cover artwork that I've not seen since. Coverage inconsistent... pro-something one month, anti same-thing the next month. Won't be renewing.",2
I did not receive prior notification of an automatic renewal.,1
Bought for man with poor sight. Wanted the print able to be enlarged.  Does not work. Want to drop the magazine,1
I didn't ask to have it delivered. I hate the propaganda. Bad.,1
A measured and thoughtful perspective of the news.,4
Not worth 46 cents an issue.  It's a political rag.  There are just too many shiny pages that I can't use to wipe my butt with.,1
Fake fake fake ass news,1
Worthless Fake 'Time' magazine..!!!,1
"Yawn,  Only more anti President Trump fake news from the lefties in the SCUM Media Network.",1
canceled subscription Not interested,1
The subscription will automatically renew and I was unable to cancel the subscription. Unacceptable.,1
As always a pleasure to read.,4
Great Purchase. My wife enjoys the Reader's Digest.,5
It is totally Impossible to read Time magazine on my Kindle!!!! I will go to the local news stand and get a paper copy!,1
Read this when I was in high school; had a lot more to it then. Still informative and good.,4
The opposite of the truth.,1
This is one magazine that is so one sided it is un-American.,1
I've been in love with Reader's Digest for almost two years now. GREAT magazine! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! :) And the deal I got on here was amazing too!,5
I ordered this for my mother-in-law. We enjoyes it and we like giving it as a gift. She will enjoy this all year.,4
"Extremely disappointed in their new version/format.  I have subscribed to readers digest for many years, but will not renew my subscription when it comes due!!!!!!!!!",1
I love this magazine and I love the price of the subscription. Amazon is the place to go to for magazine subscriptions.,5
This magazine writes many personal accounts of near personal disasters. It writes about very current items. I enjoy reading all of these articles.,4
"This magazine has been a favorite of mine for years.  It has a variety of interesting and current articles, and it is easy to scan in a short time",5
"I really enjoy reading Readers Digest, always have since we grew up getting it in the mail. I will continue to own it in the future.",5
Far left very fake news,1
Too expensive for bird cage liner.,1
Time lost our confidence with this incredibly biased article. I no longer trust this magazine to offer objective news stories.,1
"Was once great.  Now a shadow of its former self.
Don't kill a tree to get one.
Don't waste the memory to download one.",1
Very one side. Sounds like a  Democrat review. I just expect a more well rounded information source without so many opinions.,2
automatically renewed without any notice...don't like that,4
It is garbage no reason to waste your money or resources to print it.,1
This is the most bias magazine I have ever received.  They go from the mail box to the trash can.  This needs to be on the rack with the National Enquirer.....,1
Giving Donald Trump so much cover time is disturbing. Had to unsubscribe..,1
Handy way to keep renewing a great magazine. I have kept my subscription steady for over 15 years.,5
TIME HAS GOTTEN BETTER LATELY.  GOOD SOURCE OF NEWS.,4
Time is an excellent magazine,4
"I can't post what I want so all I will say is, Stay away from amazon magazines. It is a third (if not a forth) party purchase. I went direct after this blunder!",1
I just love every issue of Readers Digest because they have all sorts of articles and information that is good for everyone.,5
This is the best American weekly magazine.,5
Biased anti Trump bs. Stay away and read online for free,1
Best national and world news magazine.,5
Good reading material. I look forward to each new copy.,4
I like the magazine and auto-renew is convenient,4
Will not spend money on  a magazine that gives horrible agendas a platform. It's a shame. No respect for this publication.,1
We always like The Readers Diggest and this was the best deal you could ever find......We are glad we got it......,5
"Readers Digest has something for everyone.
No matter the subject it will appear in Readers Digest.
It is one of my favorite magazines.",5
"The Reader's Digest should have less ads; maybe some brain challenges like puzzles, word games, a section for classical music like the opera.",3
"I'm disappointed that RD has gotten much smaller.  The content isn't any where near what it used to be.  Now, I can get through the magazine in one evening.",3
There is too much fluff in the magazine. I realize they want to appeal to a younger generation but they made it too much like People magazine. It needs more in depth articles.,3
best subscription price I could find,5
Digital subscriptions don't update on Kindle fire.,1
Download is a problem,1
Best price around for this subscription I could find.,5
The magazine seems to be getting thinner over the years but all the stories are well written and very entertaining.  I've been reading this for many many years.,4
"Not as good as it used to be, but still okay",3
Glad Time is back! Great magazine!,5
"I ordered Reader's Digest on-line and requested the  large-print version.  When it arrived, it was the regular small-print version.  I would like to receive what I ordered.",1
Reader's Digest always makes a great gift for anyone! I've been reading it for almost seventy years and never get tired of it.,5
"My favorite read since I was 16! You can find a little bit of everything in here, drama, humor, games, education, it has it all!",5
Poor editing.,1
We love Time magazine and what a great deal!,5
Not a good digital version....,1
She loves it.  I love it too.  Reader's Digest is still true to its mission of timely information with lots of humor in a capsulated form.  It will be her annual gift.,5
"I really like reading this magazine, it has interesting stories and articles, but with all the prescription advertisements, it should probably be free!",4
Worst magazine!,1
Informative but thin content. Appears that the movement to the internet is affecting Time just like all other magazines and newspapers.,4
Compare to the older Reader digest... it 's not pack with well... reader Stuff.. got to cut back somewhere i guess..,3
"What more can you expect for Reader's Digest? Love it and always have copies in the library(bathroom). Has everything in it. Humor, true stories and even info on websites",5
Never noticed how terribly biased Time has become ...,1
Long time fan of Time Magazine. It's the only magazine I subscribe too. Love it!,5
I order magazines for our medical office. We try to keep magazines that appeal to both men and women. The Reader's Digests are by far the most popular.,5
"If you're looking for a one-stop place to read small articles of varying degrees of useless info, this is it! I've enjoyed this magazine for years now!",4
"it does not come regularly. In fact, i have only received 3 when i should have gotten about 6 so far.",1
"GOOD MAG. SO FAR, ONE MONTH MISSING FROM THIS 2 YR SUBSCRIPTION.",4
They didn't renew. They added a new account. I'm getting two magazines now each week. Very disturbing.  A 1 definitely.,1
I got this magazine originally for my elderly mother. I find that I enjoy the magazine myself. There is a lot of variety in it.,4
"This was a gift for one of my elderly friends who loves this magazine. Hey, anything that makes him happy!",5
I love having this magazine in my salon. This was a great price for such a fun short read magazine,5
This always has GREAT articles of interest! Highly recommend!,5
I cancelled this subscription because my present subscription is good until 2016!,1
The Reader's Digest is always good for short reading times.  I like the human interest stories they write and have enjoyed it for years..,4
"Compared to other news weeklies, this magazine would be last on my list.",1
My brother in law loves this magazine!!!!,5
"I miss Newsweek, but since it went out of business, Time is a good option.",4
"Difficult to cancel a subscription, was getting two copies, tried to v=cancel one, but the magazines and bill continue, Trying to cancel again today",1
"I resubscribe every year for this. Price is excellent, good Christmas gift.",5
I love that I got a whole year of this for only $5! What a steal! Happy to finally have some magazines!,5
Reader's Digest is a classic and love the short stories and funny columns.  A quick read you can put down and pick up whenever you have a moment,5
A very good general weekly magazine covering a wide range of topics.  There's usually something in there for every one.,4
The liberal slant of this rag is obvious. I wouldn't read it in the doctor's office.,1
"a blatant disregard for the values this country was founded upon, ptheuw.",1
"This was to extend my existing subscription.....instead you have made me a new one which duplicates
mine,  Can you remedy this?  I do not need two magazines!",1
"I would never be without this magazine. It goes way beyond the news headlines. Precise, in-depth reporting on everything plus great photography. This is my world information!!",5
Ive taken the readers digest for many years and spend much time enjoying it on the day it is received and days thereafter.,4
Not enough real news - too much fluff.,2
Cannot change the font size. Option icon not working,1
On many articles print is so small it is unreadable.  A disappointment to a long time  TIME MAGAZINE reader,2
"The best I can say for the Digest is ""It's fair, not great or terrible, just fair.""  I won't be renewing my subscription.",1
Excellent Magazine for summary information and humor. I have been receiving this magazine for over forty years. I highly recommend it.,5
I have always loved Reader's Digest.  It is a fun little magazine to keep around and read a story or page of jokes when you have a few minutes.,5
Best reading for adventure drama humor educational and for mysteries and stimulating the mind and at a great price. Thank you amazon,5
I would not download this liberal rag app to my Kindle. Every article is about same-sex marriage or transgender lifestyle - no thanks!,1
This is difficult to use.  Have no idea how to get back issues  Not worth tinkering with.  It should work out of the box.,1
I havent' got it yet.  I'd like to know when I will start enjoying it. I hope it gets here in the following days.,1
This is a nice little read that gives you insight into lots of different things.  With a toddler I don't have much time to read so this helps me keep up.,4
Wow! Thankfully I read all the reviews here! I was tempted to suscribe for the low price of $5 per year but even at that I don't see a point doing it so.,1
Keep track in your checkbook and write down when you first get your first reader's digest.  You won't get a full year.,1
Years ago I used to read Readers Digest and its no where as good as it used to be. I have been giving it away to a friend.,3
"Time magazine has been a source of news for many years.  Great magazine.  If you want analysis and good reporting in a magazine, this is it.",5
The Amazon price was the best I could find for 2 years of readersdigest. The first issue has already been delivered & we are totally happy. Thanks Amazon.,5
I was happy with this app until they made recent changes.  I also lost access to all issues in library that I paid for.  NICE!!!!!,1
This update did not fix the issue of being able to enlarge font/text size.  The app is useless except the videos built in the article,1
It is great magazine with reliable articles that are of interest to all ages.  Great as a gift to a parent or grandparent.,4
My husband and I decided we are too old for this magazine.  Many articles we know nothing about and don't care to learn.,3
I subscribed to Time because Newsweek went all digital. This is a good buy for those who still like to read...on paper.,4
"Time has been a part of our family for 40 years and will continue to do so.
I like the format and dependable world news coverage.",4
"We love the digital access on my ipad mini. My wife likes the print edition, and I read it on my iPad mini on the go. A perfect subscription.",5
"I have been reading Time for years.  It always has informative articles, plus I like the culture section.  I have recommended it to my friends.",5
Have not yet received any magazines. I'm sure it will be fine once the subscription begins. Now when will that be?,1
"Absolutely nothing interesting to read, even the ads are boring. Don't waste your money. I must of been expecting way to much from this but it seems like half ads.",1
"The service is terrible Once they have your credit card you are hooked
Beware they will continue to reorder even if you cancel.",1
Time magazine is so great! They always have well written articles that I enjoy very much. I subscribed just to use it on my iPad 2 and I donate the physical copies to my salon.,5
".. I discovered the Economist and understood what a real in depth weekly news magazine could be.  Sadly, Time does not really fit the bill anymore for me.",3
I got this as a gift for my dad and he loved it! Thanks so much! :),5
I will always purchase my magazine suscriptions from Amazon!  They are the best deal you can get anywhere!,5
We are happy to be receiving Time magazine during the election year so we can read as much as we can about the candidates. Wish we had started it earlier.,4
Great magazine! Well worth the money. Yay freedom,5
"Not bad, prefer guns and ammo",3
my honey loves this magazine.  it's great for the price.,5
A great magazine for people who love guns.,5
"I've only received one issue, but it was informative, and I enjoyed the articles.",4
Not for me. Articles did not engage my interest.,2
Does not work after iOS 8 upgrade. Have emailed vendor twice and never received a reply.,1
Enjoyable and informative read.  Feature article seemed a good and thorough review of the Pico.  Works well on Nexus 10.,4
This is my third year reading this magazine and I love it. Great reviews. A Must have for todays hand gunner!,5
"Love the articles and info lrmation about handguns - great magazine!

Lots of information about new products, shooting tips, purchase advice, and shooting accessories.",5
"AS of JUly 5, 2012, I have not received any magazines. I will galdly fill out your survey when I receieve a magazine",1
I am still waiting to receive my first edition. It is taking entirely too long for shipment. I should have purchased from bookstore!,1
"This is the best of the outdoor fishing magazines. Usually has interesting research in the front pages.

Good graphics, many species covered.",4
My favorite fishing monthly magazine and at a good price.,5
First issue came much sooner than expected! Great reviews from teenage Songhai cannot wait to venture past his local hot spots.,4

The best multi-species fishing magazine.,5

"The only thing I've recieved, so far, is the bill.

I order mine still not in I would not order this better off get thru magizine,1
I purchased this magazine in July and was told that I would receive it in October and that Amazon had no control over this. Then why are you selling it???,1
I've been a subscriber to Horse & Rider for many years.  Having it auto-renew is so nice.  I never miss an issue.,5
This magazine is ENTIRELY adds. Worthless.,1
Non stop ads! I won't renew,1
Got refund for rest of subscription.  Found it pretty tawdry.,1

"Love this magazine. Fashion, great articles and ads for the best cosmetics both affordable and the not so affordable.",5
My fashion conscious teen loves this magazine!  Her first issue arrived sooner than expected.,5

Great cover,4
weird clothing  who wears that stuff,1
waste of money. bunch of advertisements.,1
Full of advertisement and other s***ty crap. I'm surprised it's still in print.,1
"I find one decent article per issue and I like the last page where a male celebrity is interviewed .
Way too many ads!",3
"Beautiful work.  Great clean lines, photography, articles are thoughtful and presentation overall is balanced.  Well edited and curated.  A magazine of the times.",4
I did not want to renew this item and did not know it is set up for automatic renewal. I was not able to cancel because it was automatically renewed.,1
"This used to be my absolute favorite magazine. Unfortunately, it has turned into one giant ad. Quite unfortunate. Le sigh.",1
"Elle is a great magazine for both fashion AND reading. The articles are interesting and unique, and keep me entertained for quite a bit.",4
"I love Elle for the fashion, reviews, articles, but it seems that there is more advertisements than the magazine itself.",3
What can you say this magazine is great and never fails to have some great articles inside. Love the fashion articles the most.,5

I contacted them and they told me that they will ship it and until now nothing came.",1
Its pretty cool to have when you're bored or waiting. Very convenient. Alot of pictures tho...i don't normaly get this magazine,4
"I've been waiting over a month and have yeti to get the first issue. Although I'm eager for it, it's annoying to be asked to review a product I've yet to receive.",1

You are not getting fashion trends, good pictures of trends, etc.
Just boring long articles...",2

Great I love this publication. Excellent writing.,5
The best cultural magazine in the world.,5
"My favorite thing to read! So many interesting articles on a wide variety of subjects, in addition to wonderful insightful book reviews.",5
This is enabled only for page view which is unreadable. It must have enabled text and page view. Don't bother to subscribe unless this is changed.,1
I have a regular postal subscription. I have tried ten times to add a digital edition to it. No Luck!!,1
Wonderful and wise way to make the right choices in an infinite cultural space of talented writers.,5
"the best of the best, if you're into high lit",5

I like this magazine lots of stories,4
I like the star and reading it on my phone,4
I cannot open this magazine on my kindle. I will have to return it.,1
Love this Magazine. Highly recommend for entertainment!,5
I didn't receive all of my issues. Less than half have been received.,1
Too many ads/fillers and not enough good or so many incomplete stories telling you what you've already heard somewhere else.,2
Best magize ever . I don't know what i will do without it .,5
Not much that really interested me.,3
"Love the price and the pics, but I was a bit disappointed when I could not do the puzzles and crosswords games.",3
Best one of all. Get it every week...,5
Good quick read. Inexpensive.,4
Did not download onto my kindle. Was very disappointed,1
So months better than others.  Wish it had more celeb beauty content!,3
"It's Star, what do you expect? Trashy, cheesey, guilty, pleasure. It has pictures and words.  Better than sitting waiting for the doctor with nothing to read.",2
very good but hard time getting larger words but love getting the month free offer i probably will continue to buy it,4
"Deleted it's self but still charged me,  and when I tried stop it  downloading ti start with it downloaded any way.",1
cancel my subscription. I am over it. biggest pile of crap I can ever remember seeing. the low class family,1
"I'm not sure that I want to continue reading this magazine not sure I believe what they say, also don't know the price of magazine.",1
D01-2046689-0644923 I did not receive this e-magazine . It started to load and then dropped out but I was billed!,1
"was boring, nothing much to the magazine, very few pages and no news about celebrities that I hadn't heard before.",1
There is not enough content...don't know why I bought it. I won't be wasting any more money on this publication.,1
"magazines for the kindle fire just don't work. I could read it, but the amount of scrolling was so irritating that I'd never buy another magazine for the kindle fire.",1
I love the helpful style tips! The photography is excellent and the writing is superb. I will be subscribing to the print version after my free online trial!,5
"Never received full order. Received a couple months - stopped. I called then got a couple more issues and stopped. More trouble than it's worth
Made me hate the magazine too",1
"I used to really enjoy this magazine. Unfortunately, it has very little to offer anymore.  It's just a bunch of blogger articles now.",2
All ads. Very little content left in this publication. Amazon says that I need to write eleven more words. Eleven.,1
"It was a decent magazine before the editor replacement. Now it is a bad clone of Vogue and Elle, and liberal-biased.",1
Such a great magazine to relieve free as a Prime Member. Love it!,5
Placed the order on May 1 and it's now June 1. Still haven't received any magazine in the mail.,1
"Been a subscriber for many years.  Love this magazine!  Everything from fashion, to home decor, to interesting interviews.",5
too many ads but I like the fashion. I wish they gave alternative fashion at a more affordable price.,3
Just got my first issue!!  I LOVE it!  Lots of good reading.,5
No link provided to download on to kindle. Don't waste your money,1
To have the option of viewing Inc. in both versions is an economical convenience for me.,4
Good articles to make you think on a variety of topics. Using Fire HD8 and is nice and crisp. Would like to be able to use a highlighter in magazine mode and increase fonts.,4
Not nearly as good as the print version. Was very disappointed.,2
Disappointing,1
"wow, is this difficult to interact with. Unlike other mags, bookmarking is a 3 step process and is really imprecise.",3
Great rate on a great magazine.,5
Great mag and articles!!!!,4
About 20% of the magazine is interesting/helpful. Some good point of views.,4
What a deal!,5
Not for me. Much prefer the actual magazine,2
"A good magazine. Good articles, celebrity beauty tips, etc.",4
Love this magazine. Alway something I can buy,5
i love the enthusiasm and drive that i see in these entrepreneurs. it gives me alot of confidence to do what i dream of.,5
Excellent service and I would  use again.,5
Love this magazine. Keep me in the loop on business and up and comers. Great relevant content in the business world.,5
"Has always been one of my fave magazines. One of the most complete mags out there. I don't wear or use anything in the articles or ads, but it's fun to look at.",4
Love this magazine! Don't need any other fashion magazines when you have In Style.,5
"I love Inc and Entrepreneur, and getting the print and electronic version is fantastic! I plan to keep the subscription active for a long time.",5
I have not received the magazine.,1
Another great magazine for wife.,4
Unable to completely download...tried multiple times!  Canceling!,1
$5 for a years subscription to one of my favorite magazines. It came in like two weeks. Very pleased.,5
My bd started a small business this year so I bought this mag subscription for him and he loves it. He looks forward to it every month!,5
Can't read it -- the Kindle Fire version is intermittently terrible. the content may be just fine but due to continuing problems with my Kindle Fire I cannot read it.,1
"Can't review the magazine because it continually crashes when I try to open it. Payment went through fine, customer service rep was pleasant but I cannot read my purchase.",1
"Do not like the auto renewal, don't read this anymore and keep getting charged.",1
Horrible the whole magazine won't download...and I don't know how to get my money back or have it restored,1
good price when on sale. Its for my wife.,4
"I sent an e-mail canceling this subscription immediately after I hit it, and received no reply.",1
Takes a llllloooonnnngggg time to load. Ridiculously long.,1
"The advertisements are beautiful, but over 500 pages of then seem excessive.",2
I love the magazine..but not on a kindle...wouldn't load right.......frustrating....thought it would be conviniant. It was a hassle. Never did down load right.,1
"Enjoy InStyle, but the latest app for the Kindle is wrought with bugs.  It takes forever to download a page.  I've deleted and reinstalled the app, but that did not help.",3
"Not worth the price. There are other magazines that offer fashion, style and health tips that are much better at doing it.",2
"I chose to order my subscriptions through Amazon so the auto-renewal would mean that I didn't miss an issue. Well, I missed February. Never got my issue and I'm annoyed.",1
"There is a lot of fashion content, but it seems like endless pages of product promotion and advertising.  Not for me.",2
I have been reading Instyle for ages and keep loving it. It's a great fashion/beauty magazine without all the extra trash most other magazines have in them.,5
The magazine seemed to be the abreviated version. Usually the magazine is quite large.  Otherwise it was more than satisfactory.,3
Be careful with auto-renewal option. Just received auto-renewal for 1 year at the rate of $29.95 !  NOT a good deal on 2nd year.,1
"This was such a great deal on a guilty pleasure!  Love the magazine, and loved the price, availability through Amazon.",5
"More than a month and I'm still waiting to receive it!
How can I rate this magazin since I have not seen it!",1
"I typically like this magazine a lot. I purchased my subscription over a month ago, so I'm just annoyed that I haven't received my first issue yet.",3
I have yet to receive my first issue and it has been over 2 months.,1
Simply the best overall bodybuilding  magazine bar none! I'm very happy with my subscription and definitely plan on renewing. A+,5
ordered the magazine before christmas.  reported that i have still not received the issue to amazon on 2/25/11.  haven't received any response from the company.,1
"I love this magazine, it's chocked full of to the point info. i'm excited to always get the next issue, best mag by far.",5
"I have not received even one issue yet, what seems to be the problem?????? I am giving no stars whatsoever, and I demand an explanation!",1
"Very boring magazine.  The ""free"" patterns is a joke.  Try Burda or Ottobre and you won't be disappointed!",1
Inspirational look forward to receiving all the time.  Wonderful stories beautifully written pictures are awesome will continue to renew year after year,5
"Yummy - BBQ Sacred Cow! My favorite dish! Eat hearty, my friends!",5
"Disgusting, bigoted trash of a ""magazine"".  They will not receive any of my support and I look forward to them shuttering quickly after everyone forgets about this debacle.",1
Need the information in these complicated times. Very good,4
"I've been reading  ""Foreign Affairs"" journal for decades. It is the best collection of timely essays. Period.",5
Tendencious magazine... leftist propaganda.,1
The best Journal for understanding International Relations,5
One of the most exciting magazines in the world!,5
"I have bought and read this publication for 38 years,  it's a must read. Excellent, exceptional and the kindle version is phenomenal.",5
"After 6 months, I still don't have the first issue. Wonder how this speaks to the age of the information.",1
"I just cancelled my subscription because of the lack of archive access.  I enjoy the magazine itself, but the lack of the archive access is a deal killer for me.",1
"Absolutely love this magazine !! You cannot have Labs without it.
  Mother of 3, Riley,Luke, & Couch
  Ages 2, 9, & 12",5
Arrived much sooner than originally promised.  This is a great magazine for lab lovers! We are very pleased with our purchase.,5
This is a great magazine for anyone who loves their lab and treats them as an equal member of the family.,5
Changed my address and it STILL went to the old address. Furious for $24 going down the drain.,1
It's really just all fluff nonsense.,2
My wife loves this.,5
cancelled subscription,1
"Strange  mag, got as a gift, so far it has been pretty boring.",2
Requested refund articles not that good...,1
Not worth the money! Haven't read anything I couldn't on the internet.,1
This magazine is amazing! They cram so much fascinating information in every issue. I always buy it as a gift for my knowledge loving friends.,5
"My absolutely favorite magazine. informative, humorous, and always something of interest in every issue",5
It's not what I expected.  It is expensive and I thought I would find material for topics where I have to create conversations for senior groups.,1
"Awesome mag for us ""nerds"" out there. A random mix of interesting facts and topics.",5
Love this magazine! Short informative articles that stimulate the mind! I share my issues with a friend. Great gift idea if you have a science nerd on your giving list!,5
"Completely mindless, has no real content, is just a stupid waste of time. I'm cancelling my subscription. Useless waste of paindper",1
"I gave this magazine a try, but it just is not for me. It's one of those magazines that entertain you for about 10 minutes per issue. The content is just...off.",2
I've had multiple subscriptions to Mental_floss and highly recommend it. If you are a trivia buff you must get this magazine.,5
i love this magazine! i learn something new every month. so many interesting subjects. if you like trivia and want to continue learning ... read one issue. you'll be hooked.,5
Mental Floss never disappoints. I gave this subscription as a gift and the recipient loves it. Everyone who tries it becomes addicted.,5
Most of the stories are boring.  I waited the entire year to give my opinion.  I would not recommend this.,2
This a great magazine for the inquisitive with lots of fun facts and mentally stimulating stories. It was one of the best subscriptions we've had.,5
This is my favorite magazine by far.  It is full of witty articles and interesting facts.  I love Mental Floss!,5
From the magazine description I expected to be rivited at the turn of every page. Didn't happen the way I imagined. It's Ok at best.,3
best predator mag out there,5
Well written articles and excellent photos.,4
One of my favorite mags....,5
"Love my Practical Horseman.  Came even faster than promised, which is always a plus in my book.",5
"This has to be one of the best magazines out there.

I just received my first issue in October..........and I can't seem to put it down. Very entertaining!",5
Beautiful magazine but over my head.,3
Wonderful magazine for the aspiring back-yard astronomer or anyone interested in what is going on in our universe.  I am very pleased with the publication.,5
This is a decent magazine for those into Astronomy. I prefer Astronomy magazine better though. I cancelled my renewal on this and am keeping the Astronomy one.,3
absolutely - love it  -- we are able to see all the latest activity in our beautiful universe. Thank You,5
best of the Astronomy mags and it will keep you very well imformed. glad to have it back again..thank you,5
"Orders space and telescope on 12-19
promised 4-6 week delivery
now promised in mid-march
what bs",1
Not enjoyed as much as I thought it might,3
Always excited to receive a copy each month. Excellent articles that feed my curiosity.,5
Its Scientific American -- wonderful magazine.  I look forward to its arrival every month.,5
Best subscription ever.,5
"we love our scientific american. best magazine ever, and I love that I am made aware of when my subscription is coming to an end so I know when to renew.",5
Still one of the best general magazines on science.  Great way to keep up of a wide range of topics.,5
"One of the premier general science publications in the USA. It provides timely, reliable articles by practicing scientists along with fascinating and often humorous tidbits.",5
I was initially given a subscription of this magazine as a gift years ago and I have found that I really enjoy reading it.  It is in the top 2 magazines I have had.,4
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND FOR FATHER'S DAY AND HE LOVES IT.  I ALSO READ SOME ARTICLES IN THE MAGAZINE AND AM VERY IMPRESSED.,5
"As usually  ""Scientific American""  contains handful of contemporary excellent materials written by professionals of highest rank.
I love this magazine. Tolaola",5
You will know where will freeze over before your supscription is acted upon.  Gave up waiting for 2 months and cancelled.,1
I have waited 35 days to receive my first issue - it still has not come.,1
It would be nice if I ever recieve magazine.  Been waiting for the better part of six weeks.  This is just too long.,1
My husband can't wait for this magazine to arrive. It never fails he will quote or read articles to me that he finds extra interesting.,5
I cannot provide a good review for this purchase because as of today I have not received it yet.  Still waiting..........,1
Got this for my mom.  She likes it but over the past year there has been a large increase in the amount of advertisements and a decrease in the qty and length of actual articles,3
Very good information.  I love a good bourbon not and then.  A good source to find just the right one for my taste.,4
We have been getting this mag for some time now and have learned so much that we did the Bourbon Tour in KY this may.  Learn and enjoy this very special very American beverage!,5
"Really expensive magazine and not much to it. It's pretty thin and usually has a few articles that I save, but for the most part I was disappointed.",2
Hard to say if it's any good since I haven't received a single issue yet. Ordered it at the end of Dec 2016 and it's the beginning of March 2017.,1
This is a great magazine and super cheap on Amazon!,5
best ever,5
"It's difficult for me to read as the print is so small. The articles are interesting, for the money st part.",3
"Just wasn't my taste.  If I lived in NYC, I probably would relate to this magazine much better.",2
The best.,5
Did not like this magazine at all.  The print is so small it was difficult to read even with my reading glasses.  Not as good as it used to be.,2
Good articles. Sometimes lose their NYC focus,4
"New York Magazine is very interesting, if you live or work or frequently visit New York.  Otherwise I much prefer Atlantic or Harpers.",2
"I'm a Californian, but I love the articles and enjoy seeing what's up in NYC.",4
I love this magazine forever and forever and have been a subscriber for many years,5
"Best crossword puzzle anywhere.  Adam Platt, Restaurant reviewer always makes me hungry.  Nice in-depth journalism and lots of fun, frivolous stuff too",5
"the best magazine out there in my opinion! great eclectic topics. great writing, i love it. i actually keep up with weekly reading (unlike the new yorker). great social media too.",5
"Well, this is a bit of a hoax. I paid for Print+Kindle but can't read the magazine on my actual Kindle, only on my phone. This should be made more explicit before purchase.",2
I have been subscibing for over 30 years now and Amazon offers the absolutely best rates.  Extending an exiting subscription couldn't be easier or more reasonable.,5
"I received the first copy in less than 2 weeks, much earlier than expected! Love it!",5
My husband loves this magazine and it is great that we can set up an automatic renewal. We will continue with this magazine it is great for your military collectors.,5
Awesome !!!!!,5
It should come every month!  TOP NOTCH!,5
Wife loves it.,5
I'm very disappointed. I really like the magazine but have only received the first issue (July/Aug).  I'd like to know what happened to the rest of my subscription.,3
I never ordered this!!!!,1
"I like the magazine, but will order direct next time.",4
This magazine is a catalog of ads and not much more.,2
A magazine full of advertisements. Hardly any decorating inspiration or photos. Would not recommend.,1
"For 25 years I got a lovely magazine I won't name. It is/was  spendy and now this my new FAVorite.
Love it ! Eye candy and fun of gorgeous ideas.",5
A bit upscale for my budget.,3
Worthless magazine.  Don't waste your money or time.,1
Terrible magazine. Ok so it does have great pictures but very disappointing intellectually.,1
Nice magazine. Maybe a bit too fussy for my taste.,3
I absolutely love this magazine!  Great decorating ideas!!!!,5
"Wonderful magazine, always has been and I am sure it always will be in the future.",5
the best shelter magazine,5
"Have been getting Veranda for about 10 years.  I am a decorator and have loved almost every issue.  I have saved them and reread them often.
This is the best magazine !",5
"It is my favorite decor magazine.  I want many houses, creating the variety of  ambiance that I see in Veranda.",5
Inspiring!,4
DO NOT GET VERANDA.  They will send you fake invoices with threats to pay even if you are paid up for years in advance.,1
"I love this magazine and always will. Great ideas, picture and articles.",5
Awesome magazine! Plenty of great ideas! Luv it! Luv it!,5
"Veranda is one of the most inspiring shelter publications out there. Endlessly creative, beautiful photos, and fine writing.",5
I have not been receiving it and would very much like to.,1
Nice photos and ideas.,4
I have read Veranda for years and love the electronic version.  Now I can keep all the old copies I want!,5
My favorite decor magazine...and it never fails to impress!,5
This is such a great magazine.  Our patrons love the information and ads in this magazine.  One of the most popular,5
I got this subscription for my wife so she could glean ideas from it for her business in interior design and furniture remodeling.,4
I CAN DO WITHOUT A LOT OF MAGAZINES BUT THIS ONE IS A MUST HAVE. I GIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THIS MAGAZINE EVERY YEAR TO MY BEST FRIENDS.,5
Inspiring!  Cannot wait for the arrival of each new issue.  Beautifully scripted and published.  My absolute favorite magazine!  Thank you!,5
I was disappointed in the magazine due to it was mostly advertisements.  For me it was a waste of money.,1
"I did not renew it..can get at a better price elsewhere
Has been a nightmare!!
Finally got it removed from account",1
"nothing but advertising--thought it would be more like Country Living, which I love to receive each month, or Southern Living.",1
An exceptionally pretty magazine with lots o home decorating tips and photos. Mostly dedicated to high end designers but there are lots of tips for everyone.,4
Beautiful pictures and style as a designer it's one of my favorites!! Current and always full of great design ideas! would love to have gotten Nov/Dec. issue,5
"This magazine is lovely, but a bit stuffy. I prefer something a bit more modern-eclectic. I have canceled this subscription.",3
The most beautiful shelter magazine today!  Every issue has been thrilling.  I read it cover to cover and then pass it on.,5
This is a first rate publication.  Veranda features classic homes that are actually liveable.  One of thre finest magazines around!,5
"This magazine has some beautiful pictures, but it also has a LOT of ads.  Tried sample to peruse on airplane while on vacation, but will not subscribe.  Got on my Kindle.",3
Veranda is a great value and a great quality magazine. Subscription through Amazon is fast and easy.  I recommend it if you take pride in your home and your garden.,5
I especially like the crossword puzzles.,4
I'm still waiting for my first issue. I ordered British Vogue directly from Vogue a few weeks after I ordered this. I'll be curious to see which one I get first.,1
Good magazine. I found the articles helpful,4
I believe that this magazine is the premier publication on the subject of Porsche automobile models and will greatly enhance your love of the Porsche marque.,5
"Aaah, Porsche Excellence! What else can I say? I love this magazine. I always look forward to it and I'm never disappointed!",5
Great magazine dedicated to Corvettes of all years.  Well written articles and technically sound columns. I look forward to each issue.,5
"Cool magazine but not what I exspected has lots of information if you have a c3 or c6 but if you own anything else it hardly has anything about the rest such as c1,c2,c4 or c5",3
"This magazine should be considered a ""must read"" by every Corvette enthusiast. Very well written with great photography.....",5
I'm super happy with my purchase! Thank you so much! Super fast shipping,5
"So glad I stumbled upon this magazine, it is by far my favorite magazine ever. Great, helpful, informative articles with a lot of variation.",5
GREAT MAGAZINE!!!,5
"Articles are sometimes boring. I see there is a lot of activism, but it would be nice if some articles were a little more fun and exiciting for women.",3
The few things I actually liked in this magazine did not warrant the expense. I would not purchase again. There are many blogs that cover the same topics in a much better way.,2
I love this magazine. It's definitely a must read for feminists. It's one of the few women's magazines I still can sit and read cover to cover.,5
"This was a rip off. The cover showed the flip or flop couple with headline ""liars.""  I ended up getting Matt Lauer on the cover. Wish I could get a refund.",1
Can't believe any of the headlines which is. Shame!,1
How can the digital price be MORE expensive than the paper price.  Will never buy.  How stupid can they get.,1
"i love the price that i got it for, and my wife likes even more that she has a magazine to read over the weekend.",5
Boring and super old news.  The news they wrote about was always two to three weeks late. Lame.,1
Awesome magazine.  Wish we had Life Time Fitness in my town.,5
"Shouldn't have put that woman on the cover, enough said.",1
Hands down best wellness magazine available .,5
Lack of science.,1
promotes ignorance through fear-mongering,1
No magazine with the public's best interests in mind would put idiots like Food Babe on the cover of their publication.,1
"Got it for two years; a horrible mix of perfectly sound exercise advice with mind bogglingly premature or incorrect advice based on ""science"". Horrible fear based editorial voice.",1
I cancelled my subscription to this magazine because it was not all that interesting and the content seemed a little stale.,2
"w00t! I have a new science fiction magazine to follow! Thanks to ""Food Babe"" Vani Hari. Say ""no"" to pseudo science! (This is sarcasm if you can't tell)",1
The best source for health!,5
Featuring a fearmonger and her unsubstantiated claims shows just how credible this publication is.  Supermarket tabloids are less expensive and no less reliable.,1
1 star for a magazine that pushes an ill-informed fear-monger. I can't respect a magazine that would do this,1
A magazine that features food babe is a magazine that shouldn't exist.,1
This mag doesn't do its research.  Just saying something doesn't mean it is right.  Its that simple.,1
"The very fact that you've featured the crackpot known as ""food babe"" on one of your covers means that you are untrustworthy as a source of health information.",1
I guess they ran out of credible sources things to write about so no need to buy it now.  Seriously - The Food Babe???????  Who is the editor for this ragazine,1
"Putting the ""Food Babe"" on your cover kills any credibility you may have had. You're helping contribute to ignorance.",1
Vain Hair? Really? I'm unsubscribing.,1
"Nope, nope, nope. Propagating fear!",1
This magazine surrendered its last vestiges of credibility when choosing to peddle snake oil and promote the charlatan Food Babe.  Shameful.,1
"Pseudoscience bs, really? Get some real academics and scientists to talk about our food.",1
It's insulting to bank of the ignorance of the public by passing off pseudoscience as actual information.,1
A magazine which propagates half-truths and full lies is not what our world needs.,1
"I'd rather not read a magazine that features a fearmonger and self-appointed ""food investigator"" on its cover.

Enough said: [...]",1
"""Food Babe"" Vani Hari? Honestly? I didn't know this was a science fiction magazine. Say ""no"" to pseudo science.",1
"This magazine spreads dangerous, false, and unscientific information. It is deeply rooted in conspiracy theory and promotes food elitism.",1
"Sadly they've turned against their readers, and worst of all, with psuedoscience.",1
"Putting a well know uneducated fear monger (Food Babe) on the cover and then claiming that everyone that was vocally opposed to it must have been paid to do so, yeah I think not.",1
"Be careful, this magazine has misleading information and is basically a front for advertising overpriced and unproven products touted as the cure-all they are not.",1
This is truly a great magazine!  I've been getting it for over six years and will continue my subscription.,5
"Clearly, a magazine that would give credence to a liar, fraud, and ""organic"" shill like Vani Hari, is not a magazine that aims to bring any truth or knowledge to its readers.",1
Complete and utter nonsense,1
"Worst PR department in the history of magazines, plus peddlers of pseudoscience bollocks. Do. Not. Subscribe.",1
all gimmick and hype with your cover girl vani hari.,1
"The worst. No credibility whatsoever. Published fad before fact, and has no respect for the readers intelligence. WILL NEVER PURCHASE.",1
Quack science meets cheesy health magazine format.,1
Pseudoscience and disrespecting your audience? No thanks.,1
"FOOD BABE COVER = 1 STAR FOR YOU!!!

For more details on the Food Babe, her pseudoscience, and overall turdury feel free to consult the google.",1
Stop spreading misinformation.,1
Psuedoscientific BS dressed up as a health magazine.,1
"You had a highlight/Cover piece on food babe.
With that said how can anyone take what's in your mag seriously.",1
Food Babe? Really? This magazine is garbage. Don't bother.,1
You'll get more scientific fact from The National Enquirer. No thanks!,1
This magazine claims to have no gimmicks and then has the most gimmicky person online on their cover.  No thank you!,1
Promotes psuedo-science and other fear mongering garbage,1
"Disappointed to see ""Food Babe"" on the cover.",1
Way too expensive! I only get sixty cents a post as a shill for Big Pharma/Starbucks. I can't afford this!,1
we love this magazine and are delighted to be receiving it.,5
I learned a great deal from the first issue alone!,5
The best magazine for the watercolorist.,5
First magazine I received...pictures were all dull and depressing. Hoping there will be more color in future issues.,3
love this mag.,5
"Nice, but wish it had more to it. Kind of thin.",3
Always looking forward to get the latest issue. I really enjoy this publication.,4
"I love it on my iPad, and I also receive the paper copy for my husband.
All for one great price.",5
"I love this magazine and have learned  a lot from the tips displayed inside, as well as the techniques of various artists that have been featured.",5
I look forward to every issue of this magazine. It has great information and beautiful illustrations. Getting copies in both paper form and on line is especially useful to me.,5
Probably won't renew.  Too much $$ for too little helpful info.  Lots of ads.  And one or 2 artists high-lighted.  HOLLEY,3
"Reupped my subscription. Really enjoy this magazine, and love the kindle version that comes with the subscription. A must for the watercolor artist.",5
I liked being able to leaf through the magazine to see the techniques used by artists and even to gain some ideas.,4
"This is my first magazine on kindle.  I love books on kindle, but the pictures in magazines are too small on kindle.  I prefer the hard copy.",3
I love this magazine! !!,5
This mag has lots of great info and recipes! Perfect for vegetarians and vegans. I always read it from cover to cover.,5
I love my Bookmarks magazine.  It helps me decide which books I choose to buy.  It gives you reviews from multiple sources.,5
"This is the best publication around, for book lovers of all genres.",5
"This is a great source for reviews of books both old and new.  Reviews are concise and helpful in making future
book purchases.",4
I just received my first issue recently and I was a bit disappointed because it didn't have any interesting books.  I'm hoping the next issue is better.,3
"I ordered this in August, and it is now the middle of November and I STILL have not received my first issue!",1
"This is a good magazine for standard cake decorating - I was hoping for more ""out of the box"" ideas.",3
"This is by far the best cooking magazine I have used...the recipes are easy, healthy, and most of all delicious.",5
"Not a magazine, a leaflet which recommends web articles",1
Sports illustrated is the worst excuse for a magazine as you can get. No different than grocery market rag.,1
Watch out! They auto renew you and it's a pain to get it stopped!,1
"Read the sport every week,details you never find the local papers.",4
I got the kids edition and only got two of them.,1
Great price immediate delivery,5
"Who doesn't love SI, cheaper than buying it off the rack.",5
Who doesn't love Football and Fine Foreign Fannies?!!,5
Awful. Receiving SI for kids. Not as advertised. I don't have children. It goes straight into the garbage.,1
I signed up as a gift for my husband. The two that we received are the Kids version.,1
Son loves,5
awesome deal,5
"got it for a year for 5 bucks, if it was 6 bucks....probably not",3
Received on time and my husband enjoys the articles.,4
The quality of the magazine is poor at best. The images are blurry and really thin paper. Horrible,1
Only received three issues .,1
good sports magazine...writing was better  earlier in lifetime of magazine...still a readable weekly...some weeks are better than others,4
great Olympics coverage,5
"Not as thick as they used to be, very light on content. Still manages to keep me interested with some original content, but it's waning.",3
"As a sports fanatic I always enjoy Sports Illustrated. It keeps me up to date in the sports world and sometimes teaches me something
I didn't know!.",4
"This magazine ain't what it used to be, unfortunately.",3
love to keep up with sports this is one great way to do so,5
It has been a great magazine for us for thirty-five years.,5
This subscription was for my son. He enjoys the Sports Illustrated magazine. This makes a great gift for teenage boys.,4
"""Men"" magazines are now targeting ""women""?  Not for me!  Cancel please.",1
"It will take me a  wile to get used to, but I like SI and have subscribed to the print edition for several years.",4
"While the page numbers and amount of stories have decreased, they still have great writers and photographers.",4
"The writing can be good at times but honestly, if you're not into narrative style sports writing, you're better off with another publication.",3
SI ha gone downhill and is not very good!,1
I have received the magazine many years. Love it especially during football.  :). Very good rate from Amazon.,5
Sports illustrated cannot get to my Kindle without my renewing my subscription.....their is no easy way to get to the page that allows you to list your subscription.,1
best sports mag....ever....the pictures tell the story...then they tell a story too!,5
"It's easy this way, but my subscription doesn't actually expire until May.  Renewal is a little early!",3
"Review has nothing to do with content.  It simply won't download and from the looks of it, EVERYONE ELSE is having the same problem.",1
"Good to have the access, and readability is fine but response can be a little slow.",4
Renewed magazine for myself which I have been getting for last thirty years.,5
Pound for pound the best writing in the biz,5
too complicated!!!! I am going to discontinue it.,1
"Have bought or subscribed to SI since the ""Eddie Matthews cover"" in 1954, i.e., Every Issue. 'NUFF SAID!",5
love sports illustrated,5
It is hard to move around within the magazine.  Difficult to read because of the very small print on my Kindle Fire.  Because of the format I can't increase the size of the print.,1
"I choose four stars because my son loves it o the kindle, it was out first time using it on there.",4
Won't open on my Kindle. Won't download even after I entered the code. Good luck to anyone else. Subscription ends soon anyways,1
This is the best gift that I could give my oh so sports minded nephew each and every year on his birthday!  Thank you!,5
This is ok.  You can't manipulate the digital copy to make the print larger.  It reads exactly as the print copy.  Bummer.,3
When they switched from the old app I can't access any of the back issues I  was saving. Go back to the old app or fix this one.,1
This feature keeps my magazines coming without interruption without a lot of time out of my busy schedule. Pricing is right and the service has been great.,5
"a great buy and great service. Have purchased this for several years and they help me when I need to correct my mistakes in ordering.
Highly recommend",5
Sent as a gift to grandson and son. They look forward to every edition!  Happy with the choice I made.,5
I remember when this magazine actually had substance.  There is not much to it and most of what there is advertising.,3
"Got a year subscription for cheap.

First issue arrives and it has a total of 50 pages and 25 are adds. Where is the content?

Go figure.

T",3
It has been more than 8 weeks since Iplaced my order  and I still have not received my first issue.  Very disappointed in how long it takes to get the subscripton going.,1
Great price for this subscription! You get the free online access to view each magazine on the iPad which is great.  Great Xmas gift too!,5
The Sports Illustrated magazine came just in time so we didn't miss any issues.  Thanks.  Cheaper than renewing elsewhere.,4
I have been a subscriber for 45+ years and it is still the best in its genre.,5
"The best sailing magazine for used sailboat owners that I could find. The best do it yourself
 magazine for sailing out there.",5
Took months to receive the first issue. I remember this magazine been more scientific and informative but now is almost like every other women's health magazine. Will not renew.,3

"I love this magazine. It has so much information in it, and it's great to see the work others are doing.",5
"If you are interested in advertising and reading about artists interviews, then this is the magazine for you.  If, however, you want insight into methods and how to's forget it.",1
Best journal for pastel artists,5
"As a pastelist, I look forward to every issue anticipating great insights and examples of wonderful art techniques!",5
I hate to think I paid for something I did not get. But I am a newbie at my Kindle. Perhaps you have suggestions.,1
The journal has great content and tips. Only thing that would make it better is for it to be LONGER :),4
Love love this magazine!  The pictures and articles are stunning if you adore early American style.  Its a joy in my mailbox!,5
I don't know why I get this publication I don't want it but yet it shows up every month!!  this is not for me.,1
thought it was just a regualr travel magazine,1
I didn't know what the magazine was about.  there should have been a caption that it was for gay readers.,1
This magazine is a good read and it let's you know where the nice spots are that are open to the lgbt community as well as events in some cities. Try it I think you may like it.,4
Buy this magazine without hesitation.  Has wonderful articles from a spiritual and holistic perspective.  Thank you so much for creating such a creative magazine.,5
"Almost all advertising.  Lots of ready to fly stuff, but not much building.  Not in the same league with Model Airplane News and other similar magazines.",2
"This is a good magazine, a lot of banners, but still good. Go for it.",4
Almost require magnifying glasses to read.  I was hoping for more detailed stories but was not impressed so far in the couple of issues,3

My daughter in Seattle always wants this every year. I renew each year for her. She just loves the Magazine,5
"Love, love, love Atomic Ranch.  Great articles on the mid-century lifestyle and furniture and design.  Look forward to every issue and read cover to cover when it arrives.",5
"Really, this is an exciting style, but you'd never know it from this magazine! Is the the refusal to add any other style that makes
it so stagnant?",1
"If you are not looking for high end recording studio equipment reviews and articles, this magazine might be ok for you.",3
don't know what went wrong as I love this magazine but have never received even 1 issue,1
I no longer like primitive country decor.,1
"Might have been better if it was 1875 and I was an old lady. Very floral, rustic, lots of brass beds, etc. Not up to date country at all.",1
This is a wonderful publication.  I can't wait until it arrives and I immediately read it from cover to cover.  I just received my second issue and I'm sold.,5
I absolutely LOVE this magazine! Every issue is great!,5
"If you like primitive and country decor, you will love this magazine. Wonderfulness, vibrant pictures, and just a plethora of resources. Love it!",5
"I love this magazine.  It is full of ideas and inspires me to be creative every time I open it.  So many different ideas, then you get to shop!!",5
I like this magazine for primitives and country home design or decorative ideas. The magazine also has links and sites listed so that you are able to purchase these items.,4
I love all the great pictures of the primative items. It's also nice that they inform you of where the items can be purchased.,5
"love having it on my kindle....
so easy to read...
this is a great magazine to have for ideas to decorate with.",5
"This is a wonderful magazine, enjoy every page, worth re-reading several times.  The pictures are beautiful.  Never gets old. A magazine to share with friends.",5
Extremely well written articles that span a great deal of the theological spectrum while still remaining true to orthodox thought.  A pleasure to read.,5
This is an awesome magazine and the tips they give you are invaluble and i thank the people who thought of this.,5
I hve not recieved a single issue of the magazine yet. I would like to get the magazine or havey money refunded.,1
I subscribed for a year. I think I recieved a total of two copies and am now recieving notices to renew my subscription. NOT !!!!,1
"I like magazine, I'm a subscriber myself. I ordered this subscription for my brother and he is yet to receive his first issue.",3
I like these mags because I like to be current with the newest games coming out. It's not the best mag but it's pretty good.,4

I love this magazine and this is such a great deal you would be stupid to turn it down.,5
Gave as gift she is happy with it,4
Awful. I love this magazine but I only one issue out of the 12 months and I had to ask for a refund.,1
"Just got my first issue, and I love it! It prints about all if my favorite bands, and through it I discovered more! Highly recommend!",5

"The Horse is the hands down best biker mag on the market, real bikes built by real people, I love it.",5
The cost of a two month for $150 and only mon - fri is crazy. I will not be reordering this paper again. What a rip off,1
Love USA Today,5
Love the paper but managing the subscription has been a nightmare.  Probably won't renew again.,1
Great News Paper.,5
Live out in western NY where its hard to find a paper carrying national news so this fit the bill nicely. Also love doing the crossword puzzle!,5
The papers were delivered 2 dos after publication.  Best to go directly through the publisher and get it delivered same day.,1
The subscription of USA Today newspaper took over a month to start.  This is way tooo long to wait for a newspaper.,1
This has been one of the most helpful magazines re ADD/ADHD issues that I have come across. Would encourage anyone who is touched by this issue to subscribe.,4
"whether you have a kid, spouse or you have ADD yourself, lots of good information that you can use right away.",4
As time goes on I am finding the articles less and less engaging. I'm no longer excited to get my magazine.,3
Love this magazine. But I ordered this and on the receipt realized it will take FOUR MONTHS for this magazine to show up. Ridiculous. Too lazy to cancel the order.,1
A little much for me - technical sort of.  I'm more or less a beginner in this.  At least  I gave it a chance.,3
"this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time.  if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator, readsomething else.",5
"I never received this order. I received an email stating they were cancelling it and I will receive a refund for the gift certificate, but never received it",1
Fond tech article informative but they focused on 1 item to much. The magazine seemed to be filled with to much of one truck just broke down into different articles.,3
Best truck magazine I've read.,5
best truck mag ever has test's how to 's and tech info!! Love the new gear up and coming new rides.preowned rides and new accessories,5
"This is a awesome magazine for learning about the greatest up-and-coming rock bands.  It has great articles and is over-all very, very rad!!  ROCK ON DECIBAL!!!",5
A lot of ads.  Decent articles and exercise ideas.,3
I just love this mag,5
"This is my favorite magazine. They have the best workouts, advice and meal plans. I love the inspiration this magazine gives me!",5
Enjoyed it!!!,4
Love the magazine the pictures are beautiful on my new Kindle fire  HDX 8.9 Love both!,5
wonderful magazine!,5
I love Cook's Country.  I've made many of the recipes and they are reliable and excellent.  This is one of my go-to cooking resources.  Kudos!,5
I really like this magazine and look forward to receiving my next copy. I highly recommend this for all cooks!,5
"If you like recipes, shortcuts and tips on cooking, you will love this magazine. I bought it as a gift for my mother and we both enjoy this magazine.",5
"I love the magazine. I watch the show whenever I can. So many great recipes, helpful tips. I would recommend this magazine to anyone.",5
"I would say this is an ok magazine but I prefer Paula Deen, Southern Lady and TeaTime.  Others may like Cook's Country better.",3
I love the explanations so simply written.  Pictures help greatly with the how to do part of recipes.  Great assortment of cooking tips!,5
Cancelled my subscription before the 30 day free trial ended. This magazine did not hold my interest. Also found it a little difficult to read on my Fire.,2
"This magazine does not contain simple country recipes that I would cook.  It is too ""uptown"".  I have asked this magazine to cancel my subscription but so far have had no success.",1
AS AN RC PLANE FANATIC THIS MAG IS THE BEST OUT THERE. IT'S WORTH EVERY CENT!,5
"i hate this magazine.  it always comes late, if at all.  i don't have any problems with the other magazines i subscribe to.  buyer beware!",1
Auto renewal is a hidden charge! Would not purchase this product again!,1
"This is how I received my first magazine. It is torn apart, and someone tried to paste it, but couldn't have done a worse job. And I can't find the way to complain about this",1
Pain in the ass to read this on a Kindle - and if signed for 30 day free trial. Good Luck finding a link to actually cancel it.,1
DON2T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.,1
The kindle app is HORRIBLE!  Why in the world is it not like the iPad app?!  Almost makes me regret buying the Fire.,1
A once-great journal has joined the vapid heard & now sells the same shallow narrative as all the rest. May it Rest In Peace.,1
Their app has been multiple charging our accounts. And then it is difficult to get a refund. Must fix it this century - right?,1
"Economost provides well informed, factual information that broadens ones knowledge on global politics and markets.",4
"Great magazine, but quite expensive.",4
The subscription never started.,1
I love receiving my weekly issue.,5
Not compatible with a Microsoft phone!,1
The best magazine there is. Period.,5
Horrible beyond description. Bad customer service and declining quality of articles as well. I will walk away,1
A great read every week.  Never disappointed.,5
The navigation features are archaic. You should be able to view the different sections and their content more easily.  The android app is much better in that regard.,3
Access .  Please cancel.,1
Don't like the format.  Love the pub though.,3
The top quality research and best business language!,5
"App does not work, account gets charged without the magazine actually downloading",1
The best in-depth business mag.,5
Excellent journalism.,5
Does not come with digital access. The economist sells the Print + Digital subscription for less on their website. Deeply disappointed,1
One of the best magazine for world news.,5
Ridiculous that paying for the online edition doesn't get you access to the Kindle version as well,1
"Good topics and analysis, but price of kindle can be lower than printed version for one issues and also subscriptions..",4
Nowhere does it say whether the $9.99 price is for an annual or monthly subscription !!How deceptive is that ??,1
this price is too high.  the paper magazine gives same content for less. kindle jacks up the price. what a scam!,1
Best news magazine out there.,5
I love this periodical,5
Highly recommend!! Well written great angles!!,5
Simply the best!,5
Very disappointed. The Kindle version was very abbreviated and definitely not worth the price.,1
Too liberal sometimes,3
"The Economist. I like it but it is a trifle expensive for my pocketbook.  To buy it now and then is okay, but not a subscription to the magazine.",3
Awesome unbiased news source. Great once around the world for international politics.,5
"It's simple, Not the same as news stand but same price you should have it lesser priced to compensate the fact that your not getting the same product",3
"is always a learning experience reading this magazine, i like not to read opinion, i lie to read information to reach my own conclusion",4
"The Economist is the best single periodical for keeping up with current events across politics, international affairs, science, economics and more.",5
"DO NOT BUY THIS HERE. For one it is too  expensive and two, the actual economist version is much better than the amazon subscription.  I am hugely disappointed.",1
This mag is in the good category .It is worth the 10dollar fee. It helps me keep up with the latest on economics,4
"I don't get it. It's almost like they don't WANT to sell this on the Kindle, so they over-price it.",1
You are better-off getting print and on-line subscription and then access it in your Kindle. The kindle economist is quite skinny.,1
Great magazine but getting less for a higher price is not worth it.  Do not subscribe to the kindle edition!,1
"too expensive, especially if taking into concideration the print student subscription... sorry amazon, but ill rather read the economist in print, for approx 30% lower price...",1
In Canada we buy the US edition of the Economist at the newstands. Why on earth is it not available on Kindle?,1
"What a failure in marketing and price setting.
Enough has been in said in the other comments.
Whomever made the decision to price at this level should find another line of work.",1
Through academic subscription I can get the print copy delivered for $75. This quoted price for an electronic version is outrageous.,1
I was excited to learn the Economist was on the Kindle but there are no archived issues?  I only wanted LAST week's issue and can't even access it.  That's frustrating.,1
Why does it take a week to make the Kindle version available.  i find it very convenient to read and search but do not want to be a week behind in reading.,3
I am not subscribing to the economist on Kindle because of the poor comments of the other customers.,1
The Kindle subscription price for this publication is absurd ($35 annually more expensive than the print version),1
the kindle user won't bother with the paper version so it is not an issue that if you offer lower price on kindle the sales will drop. exactly the opposite.,1
"This price is not just ridiculous it's offensive...  It's ""The Economist"", shouldn't they understand price points a little better than this?!?!",1
"Well, perhaps the The Economist audience was the wrong population of reader upon which to attempt extortion?",1
The Economist magazine needs to hire a good economist who can advice them on how to set a proper price for the Kindle version of the magazine.,1
"who's seriosly going to pay more to get less.  Love the magazine, but I think you've lost your way on this one.  Very disappointed.",1
"The Economist's content is and always has been great.  But an electronic edition that costs the same as the print is pure robbery.  Once it drops in price, I will subscribe.",1
"It's a shame that the Economist, and probably to a lesser degree Amazon, are trying to gouge their customers after they've spent so much time and energy building goodwill.",1
I love the Economist and am all for saving a few trees and getting the kindle version but the price needs to be lower than at the news stands - period.,1
"Who would pay this amount for an electronic version ??
I am just dissapointed.",1
"I was looking forward to the Kindle version of the Economist, but this is too expensive for an electronic version.",1
"I've wanted this magazine for 6 months, and finally splurged and got it.

I love reading this magazine each week!  Puts all other news magazines to SHAME!",5
Liberal Bias Junk....,1
Not interesting. Too many subjects that are irrelevant.,2
Excellent price for subscription. Recipient was pleased.,5
A little out of touch with main stream America.,3
I get this magazine to stay up on all the new and greatest things to buy.,3
DIDNT LIKE,3
Oprahs usual trash...,1
Love It! Love her! So grateful to have this magazine in my life. It's a gem!!!,5
"All of a relevant information at this time are inside , love love",5
for $5 subscription a year. AMAZING!,5
would give it a negative star but thats not available. why anyone would give this racist a penny is beyond me!!!,1
"I like it because the vaiarity of  subjects and I admire Oprah a lot and the last page  What I know for sure, is my favorit one and what I read it first.",4
Love Oprah!!!!,5
Great magazine.  My company also enjoys the articles.,5
Best price ever.,5
I've tried everything and can't open the app.,1
I love the magazine but even with enlargement feature the layout of some copy makes stories hard to read.,3
Terrible - who needs to listen to a  narcissist ?,1
Love my O magazine subscription!,5
"I love O, The Oprah Magazine.  Subscriber to hard copy for years. Trying the kindle version is a treat,",5
Thank You so much Amazon!! The Oprah Magazine continues to inspire and delight me daily!!,5
"Oprah, what can I say.  Nothing is as laughable as someone who believes they are way smarter than they are.  Lots of advertising, very little usable content.",1
I did NOT order this!,1
Oprah was a $5.00 magazine for one year so it was hard to pass up. Perhaps a 3.5 to 4 stars may have been better. But quite frankly I purchased it for the great price.,3
Great magazine. Very inspiring.,5
Always great ......,5
Scam...Shame of Oprah trying to take advantage of people that actually think she cares about any of them.,1
You could not pay me to buy this horrible magazine again.,1
I absolutely adore Oprah...I always love to read her What She knows for Sure on the last page of her magazine.,5
"thank you. I work for weight watchers, so I love reading her magazine",5
"I have always enjoyed this magazine, but feel like recently there are more ads than newsworthy articles!",4
don't feel like supporting a racist woman who thinks all white males need to die off....,1
I currently have an Oprah magazine subscription but I'm unable to get the free Kindle edition.,1
I love everything about this magazine. Best birthday present ever.,5
"I like it. Some of the stories are interesting, and the recipes.",4
I have enjoyed this magazine for years. I renew every year for 17 years now.,5
Will not buy.  Too many adds.  To elites.  Down home girl here.,1
Don't like,1
Bias and anti white,1
Why would I want to read something from the most popular bigot on the earth?,1
This magazine consists more of ads than articles. Greatly disappointed.,1
"I have only gotten the one issue, but so far so good.",4
They make it VERY HARD TO CANCLE my subscription!  I was on the computer about an hour before I could get a phone  number!!,1
Not a fan.  Lots of make up and style tips.  I was hoping for substance.,1
Never managed to download the magazine,1
The reason why I gave this a one star cause it  can't work on my Alcatel one touch fierce xl phone,1
Great magazine! Fantastic price!,5
It was informative,4
I have been a subscriber for several years and the magazine never disappoints. The articles are always relevant.,5
Great starter subscription price!,5
My favorite magazine. I always read it cover to cover,5
I LOVE THIS CREATIVE LIFE AS IT IS MAGAZINE !!!!!!!!!,5
"I have not been able to read the magazine, because it states, ""Your magazine download is in progress.""",1
I like it so far.,4
Dumb and so self serving.,1
Will not resubscribe..,2
Best book ever!,5
Just an Oprah advertising format. Not worth opening.,1
"It is impossible to cancel subscription, even for the deceased.",1
I've renewed this magazine for my mom and she LOVES it!,5
Didn't like it !!,2
"Informative, easy reading and practical",4
"Great magazine.  Although, better before the latest re-vamp.",4
The best magazine ever. Lot of articles which I found every time very interesting....Full of beautiful photos..,5
"I can read this online via my library, but prefer the print version. I got it for a year at a really great price so couldn't resist getting a years subscription.",4
would love to read it but so far have been waiting three days for it to download and still cannot see more than the first two pages.  grrr.,1
O Magazine is a quick and easy read- sometimes just hits the spot!,4
OPRAH! Must have every month.,5
Unethical renewal practices.  If the magazine was really worth the price this would not be necessary.,1
I love this magazine on line . It is very assessable on line anytime ready anywhere I am.,5
All / too many ads,2
Tablet screens are too small for magazine reading. Please make available for kindle pc.,1
I do not want to receive this magazine!,1
"Although the magazine received lots of coverage and advertisement, I don't think it lived up to all its pomp and circumstance. I lost interest in its content pretty quickly.",3
I did not want auto-renewal so I cancelled it.,1
This is a good magazine with lots of helpful information.,4
The magazine's quality has declined in the last two years. Much of it is repetitive and predictable. No longer relevant.,3
"My wife loves this magazine, and I was able to get an amazing deal for a two year subscription.  It was less than a three issues at the new stand price",5
"I just renewed my subscription to this informative
and popular magazine for the third time.
Have liked most monthly issues! Good price
at 10.00 dollars per year!",4
I like the content and is very easy to navigate through the electronic version.  I would recommend rides to anyone.,4
"Good articles - I enjoyed the articles on minimalism.  I think there are too many advertisements, in relation to the number of pages.",4
"This magazine is always good.  Good articles, recipes, featured items, Dr Phil, Suzy Orman, overall worthwhile to read each issue.",4
"otherwise I wouldhave not ordered it, it is pretty much ads ads ads and not much else - what are you gonna do lol",1
This magazine is awesome. I love that it hits so many topics that effects women of all ages. Thanks for the variety,5
I love the articles and products reviewed in this magazine. The fashions are super and subjects for articles are always great.,5
"O is my favourite magazine - always chuckful of information, advice, recipes, suggestions and support .  These magazines are keepers and they are timeless.  Great columnists.",5
"this is fifty pages of advertising. really, why would you pay for that. not for me. it's really really not.",1
There wasn't anything interesting to read in this magazine compared to other magazines.  I would not order another one this was my second try in reading this,1
Thought provoking articles mixed with fashion and beauty. It's the BEST! Who doesn't love Oprah? What are you waiting for subscribe!,5
This is a wonderful magazine.  Purchasing from Amazon was the best!  I highly recommend it!  The articles are interesting and well written.,5
"I really didn't want a renewal and tried to stop it but must have selected the wrong option...it's okay that I have it now, just don't always have the time to keep up with it.",3
I never authorized this subscription to be automatically renewed.  Oprah magazine STOLE the price of the renewal from me.  This is a very dishonest business practice.,1
"Now I know why I paid $5 for the subscription. There are more ads in it than stories. I love real life stories, not look at things I can't buy.",3
Ordered in December.  I have yet to get a magazine.  I think I made a big mistake.  No answer as to why I have no magazine.,1
So far not very satisfied!  I am still waiting for my first issue to arrive.  Paid for it on 12/6/12 - almost 2 months ago.,1
i CANNOT TELL YOU HOW THIS MAGAZINE IS AS ALL i GOT WAS A LETTER THAT THEY WERE BACKED UP ON ORDERS AND WOULD RECIEVE IT LATER. THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.  WHAT HAPPENED.,1
"It's Oprah! Besides it's always filled with lots of tips, food, clothing, jewerly, places to go and of course books!",5
I have been a devoted Oprah Magazine subscriber for years.  I was very dissappointed to learn that I have to pay for the print and digital copy.,1
"I have yet to see a copy of the magazine or any confirmation that a renewal has been made, so the jury is still out on this.  So far, not impressed.",1
I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would and I don't miss receiving it at this point.,3
I renewed this magazine for a great price - couldn't ask for a better deal.  I have been getting this for years!,5
Too much advertisement.  The articles are good however would like more articles and less advertsing. Received two issues not a year's worth.,3
So far every issue of O Magazine has been filled with alot of interesting articles and great advice.  I look forward to receiving it every month.,5
"jjust like reading the mag. color good on kindle fire, would be better if table of contents always accessible. saves on ecologic waste.",3
First magazine I downloaded and I found The Oprah Magazine easy to navigate. Only problem is that the June edition was so-so. Maybe July edition will be better?,3
"I have not received this magazine yet from my order.
So I am not able to give my opinion yet.",1
I still haven't recieved my first copy of this magazine and it was purchased at the beginning of March and it is almost May now.,1
It's an ok magazine.  It was a good price when I purchased it.  It does take a long time for the 1st magazine to arrive.,3
"I ordered a gift subscription at the Amazon $5 rate, and 8 months later, not a single issue has been sent, and not one reply to any email requests for explanations or refunds.",1
I have not even received the ordered item and it was ordered over a month ago.  Kinda tough to rate or get excited about it.,1
This magazine has lot of good stories and tips. Easy layout to the magazine as well.,4
"I, also, ordered this magazine from Amazon for one year but have not received any issues.  Seems to be a recurring theme.",1
I have NEVER received this magazine. I ordered quite a while ago and Amazon said it should have been here by now. I am VERY UPSET!!!,1
"Though I have not received my first issue yet, I have subscribed to Oprah Magazine in the past.  I enjoy the articles which are timely and of interest to women of all ages.",4
What a fantastic offer from Amazon.  I will now always look at Amazon first to order my magazines!,5
How can I review something I have not received?  If Amazon is not going to send me the magazine refund my money!  Should be no star.,1
receiver of this gift has not received the gift and it's been more than 30days from ordering and paying for the gift by me.,1
"I ordered this magazine 12-13-2009 and have never received it as of yet. You wanted my review, so here it is!",1
"Today is February 12, 2010.  I ordered this December 15, 2009.  Have never received the first copy--when can I wxpect it?",1
"I would review this magazine if I received it!  It's been two months, and I have not yet seen one copy.",1
"Ordered two subscriptions in December, here it is Feb 8th and I still have not recieved a copy.",1
All these weeks and I still haven't received my first issue.  I am very disappointed with this whole experience.,1
I ordered my Oprah magazine subscription a month ago now. I still haven't recieved my first issue. Still waiting......,1
I suppose it is ok.  I ordered it on Dec 15th and have not received it as of Jan 17.  I have paid for it so I guess it will show up soon.,3
"Interesting, timely, applicable, varied - all of the above - and all as tastefully done as her show has always been - typical Oprah!",5
I really love O Magazine - it always has great articles and the color photos are excellent quality. Makes for a great gift!!,5
Two year subscription to O- Oprah magazine.  This was the best price I could find anywhere and it was delivered promptly!,5
I was very happy to find such a great deal on one of my favorite magazines. I can't believe I have gotten two issues so soon.,5
Absolutely the best price I've seen anywhere - $24 for 2 years ($12 for a year). Much more affordable than the magazine publisher offers!  ~ Jan,5
I bought a subscription to 0 Magazine for my mom on Mother's Day. She really enjoys it,4
mag not all that good.  not even good enough to go through a second time as I usually do with mags.,1
"This item was ordered as a Mother's Day gift, and has not yet (as of 5/29) been received",1
"The O magazine is great and Amazon offered a great deal.  Great articles, pictures and enjoyable to read.",5
"I bought a subscription for my mom, and she loves it.  What more can I say?",5
Oprah is so wonderful and I will always be enthusiastic getting her mag in the mail.,5
"Great magazine for reading anytime. My only complaint is

the font is a bit small and makes it harder to read

in train or in the Gym.",4
"I am sure this will be a great magazine, but I have not received my first issue yet.",1
"This magazine is wonderful.

It gives me information on fashion, cooking, furniture, etc.

This is the best magazine that is perfect for any woman",5
This is a wonderful magazine it takes me back every time to my roots...love reading it brings back memories and reminds me to make my own with those I love.,5
Always on point with the latest trends. I look forward to every issue!,5
Nothing  more than an ad for surgical procedures.,2
I love this mag. it keeps me current,5
New Beauty mostly advertisement needs more research information.,3
Products advertised are high end and not affordable to the majority.,1
I like to read all things beauty and so does my daughter.  So this was a good magazine for us.,4
Not enough information on the beauty products. A lot of pictures but no info.  It does have a lot of products,3
"I downloaded this for my Kindle, every page is an advertisement. I cancelled the subscription. And the few products it did show, the average person can't afford them anyway.",1
Never ordered this,1
my mom loves the magazine,5
Great and easy transaction--fast shipping and product arrived in great condition. I would definitely recommend this seller!,5
I have not received this product and delivery is 6-8 weeks. That is too long as I have already paid for the subscription. I'am not happy !,1
Both my husband and my brother love this magazine.  They can't live without it!,5
great product thx,5
Not what I had hoped it would be.  Did not renew....,2
This magazine does not meet our needs and do not wish to renew.  The magazine of the past was more suitable.,1
Hubby's favorite magazine.  Getting it in the mail is way easier than having to go to Walmart (the only place that carried it) every week!,5
"Not exactly what I expected. Actually not even close. A bunch of crappy ads for surplus military stuff, black guns, etc. I thought I was going to get some news about shotguns.",1
"My hubby loves all the info this thick gun magazine brings. It is by far his favorite for everything ""gun realated""!",5
"I have not received my order of Shotgun news as of yet ???
cannot rate since i haven't received it yet",1
Can do without the sexual covers but this magazine is filled with great information,4
I feel like Women's Health isn't a true health magazine anymore. It's more like a trashy Cosmo with more focus on losing weight...doesn't exactly inspire me to get to the gym.,3
I canceled my subscription.  I think against nudity I just don't like it in my magazine,1
not what I expected. not for retirees,2
Can't get rid of them  worst than Facebook to cancelling.....,1
Tasteless!!! As bad as a porn magazine. Now i cant have books on here for my kids. Just disgusting!!!!!!!,1
Good magazine with informative articles.,4
Awesome!!,5
"great magazine, Fiance overseas loves it",5
My niece ordered it off my Kinda never wanted it not impressed at all,1
Format difficult to read.,1
"I like some of the articles, but I don't plan on renewing it, since I don't get as much out of it to renew.",3
Love this mag.very helpful,5
This magazine is okay.  Its more ads than anything else but it does have a few good articles. I wouldn't renew.,3
I did not knowingly purchase this subscription. I do not want it. I don't take the time to read magazines. I have not read this and do not intend to.,1
"I will be canceling my new subscription this was not what I was hoping it would be, thankfully I am still within the 30 day trial",1
Great price for a great magazine. I have loved Men and Women's Health for as long as I can remember.,5
I did not want to buy this it I s not what I like it's not what I look a t,1
"I love this magazine, it is so informative and helpful. It has great articles, tips and facts for any women. Love it and will renew when the time comes",5
"I'm already paying for the subscription. Why can't I download the magazine under ""current subscriber?"" Many magazines do this. What gives? One star until things change.",1
"The information is all good and helpful, but seems to be geared more toward women younger than their 30s.  Some of the articles were of no use to me at twice that age.",3
Why does Women's Health seem like nothing more than an ad for the latest trendy product or device month after month?,2
"Geared toward under-30 women who already look good. Heavy on the fashion, light on the health.  Would not have purchased had I seen a preview.",2
I actually received a renew email concerning the subscription...out of 10 magazines purchased I only received 3.,1
I like this magazine but have received only one issue since subscribing a few months ago. That's why I gave it one star.,1
Great magazine for diabetics just far too many advertisements.,3
"Great magazine!  This is one of the best magazines for people living with diabetes.  Very informative, good recipes too!",5
"Some good recipes that I will us, many that I will not due to my tastes.",3
"one of my favorite magazines. I read it from cover to cover and then read it again.
  I just wish it came out monthly- its a long time between issues",5
Read above. I have tried other magazines about diabetes and this one is tops. I have suggested to friends and family.,5
"great magazine, I am really enjoying the recipes and the great information, also the colorful pictures. One of the best magizines ever.",5
Just love this informative book. Came ahead of time also.  Has alot of helpful info on managing diabetes. Recommend it,5
"The one I received has a  lot of good ideas n& receipes. Can't wait for the next issue.
I like surprises.",4
"WE HAVE BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING FOR THIS MAGAZINE, WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT YET! CAN YOU PLEASE SEND IT TO US.",1
I have recently been diagnoised with the onset of Diabetiac.  I am trying to control by diet.  Diabetic Living has some very good recipes and articles.,4
I got this for my 88 year old grandpa for Christmas!  He loves it and we love listening to his stories about the war!,5
Great magazine with lots of information.,5
My husband looks forward to receiving every issue.,5
For Hubby--not to my taste,3
I am thingking about fulltime rving and this is a good resource for me.  It is a starting point I am pleased with the first issue I have recived.,4
"nice reviews of destinations, everything else is advertising.
New to RVs so I am not sure what to expect.
Well see",3
"I have not received anything from this magazine yet.  According to past reviews, they are very slow at starting the subscription and I guess thats correct.",1
THIS IS A GREAT INFORMATION SOURCE.  HAS SO MANY NEW IDEAS TO USE ON YOUR CAMPING TRIP.  JUST LOVE THE NEW MOTOR HOME REVIEWS,5
"Just bought a trailer and thought this mag would be worth reading. It's one of my favorite mags now, totally full of great articles and trailer tips. Highy recommend it!",5
the company let my suscipt run out now it taking them 3 months to get me back on? no notice that you at the end of your year! It like they really don't want your business anyhow?,1
Just full of all kinds of info!  Fun and educational ! Love it !,5
Informative but couldn't get into the lifestyle.,3
"Wonderful magazine. Wide variety of subjects. How about some Northeast camping that's not all Maine seacoast. Talk about Upper NY, Vt., NH.",4
Not the magazines fault but I thought it would be more based upon travel trailer reviews and less about destinations to go visit.,2
"while we have found tips  in this magazine, it appears to be mostly for people in bigger rigs and more expensive rigs. it does have some nice articles about places to go.",3
"I don't know why I was asked to review this. I've yet to see a copy. Maybe someday it will come, until then it's less than one star.",1
"Got this two years in a row for my sis in law. She is obsessed with cooking and her, so it is always a hit and for 20 bucks how can you go wrong.",4
Great Deal and love Paula Deen's recipes which are easy and delicious.  Paula Deen is always a five rating in my opinion.,5
I love Paula Dean and her magazine is great also and a good deal on the price from amazon,5
"I am looking forward to receiving the magazine, BUT it's taking 2-1/2 months to receive the first issue!",3
"I prefer Classic Bike, maybe because I lean towards old, Brit Bikes. I've only seen 1 issue, perhaps the next ones will be more to my liking.",3
Dense with information on a vast variety of topics. Well worth every penny.,5
Very interesting stuff!,4
I enjoy this magazine and usually take a copy with me on trips.  It is one of the few magazines in which (almost) every article is interesting and thought provoking.,4
"I need help, i don't know who to contact but i only received 1 magizine and i ordered the 1 year subscription. So far i haven't been receiving any magazines since.",1
I love this magazine; it relates to everyday life with great research backup!,5
"Love it the articles on brain physiology, chemical balances, behaviors and emotions and how they interact with society is
excellent. Content the best.",5
I love this magazine. It is always interesting and well written.,5
"Bought this magazine for my dad, he loves it. It comes on time every month and he eats it up as soon as it arrives.",5
I've read the reviews where it's nothing but fluff.  I still enjoy it.  If we didn't have pretenious people in the world we wouldn't know what pretenious was.,4
Anyone interested in how the mind works can't help but be fascinated by nearly every article in each issue.,4
"I look forward to this magazine. Too bad it only comes every other month. If you love learning about the science of the brain, you'll want this magazine.",4
This is the first time I have subscribed to this magazine.  I really like the article topics but wish that there was more data included to back the articles.,4
"Time-sensitive data such as mint release dates and pricing is not current in a monthly magazine such as this, but the articles are very interesting and I enjoy it very much.",4
"Magazine is good, however Kindle support is very poor. God help you if you have to call Amazon.",1
Limited (boring) articles; too many advertisements; worthless. I will not renew.,1
Some interesting reading ..,4
I purchased this magazine and I can not get it to show up in my kindle?  What good does it do to buy print & Kindle when you can not use it?,1
Item did not renew,1
This magazine is a must have for any coin collector.  The monthly price guide is great. The articles are informative and fun to read.,5
Great magazine for reloads,4
Overall the magazine is pretty good. Easy reading. Gives me something to do for about 15 min's a month. Came during the time advertised.,4
Makes me feel like less of a man to read this stupid magazine.  Advertisements and fluff articles.  Like Martha Stewart Living and the New Yorker for suburban men.  No thanks.,1
"Wow about 1/8"" thick with most of it ads. What a joke",1
not what I expected.,2
Very disappointed nothing like the past outdoor life magazines will not re-order,1
I have never been a subscriber. They spam me every day. I hate them.,1
"I ordered wrong magazine. Thought I ordered Outdoor magazine. NOt interested in hunting, guns, etc.",1
"Great magazine for anyone who enjoys hunting,fishing and outdoor activities.",5
Great magazine over a lot of years!,5
good price but got duplicate issues.,3
A good read for the outdoors-man.  I wish they had more articles covering western mule deer and elk.,4
"Great Magazine.
And so cheap.
What's not to love",5
Great Magazine At A Great Price!,5
"I really like this magazine. The price was right, so I took a chance & I really like it. I will be renewing.",4
Good magazine for the outdoorsman.,4
Perhaps I mixed this up with a similar magazine but the first 2 issues we received very totally devoted to a few areas that have no interest to us,1
I've been reading Outdoor life since I was a kid. I really enjoy the tips and new ideas it comes up with. I just wished it focused as much on the south as it does the midwest.,4
Too many ads not enough content,2
I have bee a reader since the 60's and it is not nearly as good as in the past! The size and content is much smaller.,3
grandson enjoyed it.,4
"Mostly it appears to be just a long advertising brochure .  Would appreciate more ""how to"" or ""did"" articles without an underlying ad theme.",2
"great magazine. my bro loves the articles and the gift. He spends all the time he can in the woods, so this is the perfect magazine for him. yeah!",5
"The actual magazine is great when you get it.  Some months go by with nothing, then a couple show up at once.",3
"Great magazine, but I didn't want to renew but it did automatic. I didn't like that wished I would of know.",3
"Wow... so this is what a ""magazine"" with 99% ads looks like... Cosmo isn't this bad, please don't waste your money.",1
I have NOT RECEIVED any copies of this magazine from the publisher as of  today's date  (01-17-2013).  It seems to take a while to get the subscription process rolling.,1
"I have not recieved any issues as of this time 12/29/12
I have yet to recieve my first copy and therefore can not give you an opinion of this magazine",1
"I grew up with Outdoor Life and Jack O'Connor, etc.  I didn't realize how it has shrunk over the years. It's quite thin. Fewer pages.",2
Dont  like or want it canceled last month no refend very upset.item says cancellation still being processes for about 2 months now .,1
"I don't have an old house, but I enjoyed the book and learned a few things that will help with any age house",4
Clearly not a mag for middle income people.  Even the recipes have ingredients that your local grocery store is not likely to carry.,1
It's not a bad magazine but it sure could be better. My real complaint is that every where and everything they recommend/suggest/etc. is well beyond most peoples financial realm,3
Lots of ads. Like a little vacation.,3
I like this magazine.,4
Not as good a mag as it used to be,3
My favorite magazine at an incredible price!,5
This was a gift for my wife and she has enjoyed it.,4
No substance all ads. Cancelled subscription after receiving first magazine,1
Liked the magazine very much.  Decided to get a subscription!,4
Did not meet my expectations.,1
"Its really nice just extremely THIN!  If it gets much thinner, it will have to be called a Periodical.",3
Very disappointed. It's nothing more than an advertisement for international resorts.....I will not renew.,1
It's a lot of very expensive stuff. I live near the beach but I can't afford a $500 umbrella stand.,3
"My vision of great vacations is anywhere on the water or near the shore, so this magazine gives me a glimpse of that throughout the year. Love it!",5
Best magazine for anyone who loves the coastal way of life!,5
"Disappointed.  Way too many advertisements.
We own a vintage beach house. I was hoping for more articles on average coastal homes and towns. Not just high dollar properties.",2
"Even though I don't live on the coast, we visit North Padre Island fairly often, and we lived near Corpus for many years.  I will probably renew this one.",4
I just love this magazine. The photos are excellent and there is always a freshness about it!,5
repetitive if you have received it for a long time!,3
Coastal Living is my favorite magazine.........love it!!!,5
Always love this magazine,5
Very little content.  Pretty boring.  Would not subscribe to this publication again.,2
Excellent. Highly recommended.,5
"Great pictures for decorating beach homes. Would love to see more west coast homes, though.",4
"Content just ok, will not be re ordering",3
"Love this magazine , all about coastal decorating and beautiful places to see. Definitely a great magazine to purchase",5
Boring. Other magazines do it better.,2
awesome magazine.,5
Best magazine! If I could only get one magazines e this would be it! Full of great decorating ideas along with amazing recipes and so much more!,5
"My first issue ever, and I think the photos are lovely, and and it is both informative and entertaining.  I think I am going to really enjoy the future issues",4
I love everything about Coastal Living!,5
"This is a great magazine with more helpful hints, wonderful destination suggestions and all without gobs of ads. I read out from cover to cover.",5
"Pictures are good ,but the magazine is mostly pages of advertising. Not very good viewing on a kindle. Much prefer the printed version.",3
My favorite magazine! Been receiving Coastal Living for years. Love all of the beautiful decorating ideas for life on the water!,5
I can't wait to get this almost every month.  It's colorful and full of wonderful ideas even if you don't live close to the beach.,5
"From exotic destinations to quaint locales, Coastal Living brings the essence of life by the sea to every edition. Superb!",5
"Coastal Living  is a great read!
I have gotten it for many years and love it. Living in Hawaii is as coastal as it gets!
Hula Girl",5
This magazine is on constant renewal for me. It is the best take me away magazine. Highly recommended for all.,5
Love this magazine not only for the decor but also for the recipes. We live at the Jersey Shore and a friend recommended this magazine.,4
"this was an awful magazine..nothing like what it used to be...very few photos, seems almost unprofessional now somehow..i don't read it and am sorry i subscribed.",1
My wife and I and entire family love the ocean and spend as much time as we can near water. This magazine makes us feel like we are right on the ocean edge.,5
"Love, love, love this magazine. I'm remodeling a beach ouse on the coast of GA and this magazine gives me so many good ideas.",5
Still waiting for 1st issue. Nobody can answer me when it is coming. Very frustrating when you can't get answers.,1
"For people who live or want to live on the Gulf of Mexico coast, this magazine provides helpful articles on decorating and landscaping.",4
I have received one issue of this magazine and like it so far.  The casual style of the decorating appeals to me.  I am enjoying the articles also.,4
I have read this many times and order a year and still have not gotten one copy!  It is now mis oct!!,1
I subscribed to this magazine in February 2014 and have yet to receive a single issue.  It is October 2014.,1
Such great info and great stories. Love getting this in the mail! Has great stuff that I never knew about!,5
This magazine is so very helpful and most informative. Great magazine!!!,5
"informative; not too complicated; easy to understand; helpful to both T1 and T2 diabetics and families, newly diagnosed or long term.",4
I have only read one issue but so far so good. delivery was faster than any other magazine I have ordered. This will help our family eat better and take care of our bodies.,4
Interesting articles. I seem to learn a bit more about audio systems in each issue. It's up to date on all the latest technology.,4
ok articles,3
If you like out of the ordinary foods this book is for you.,3
Love this magazine !  Great recipes and tips from top Chefs.  Pictures that look so delicious you  c an't wait to try the recipe !!,5
"I loved it , Very informative I  really love the hints and suggestions, it is really well written, I could not put it down.",5
Love it well worth the monthly investment. Now I just sit back and wait for mail,5
My sweetheart loves that magazine we both love Rachael Ray,5
"I can't wait to get the magazine in the mail.  Wonderful, easy to make recipes.",5
I love rachael ray every day it has a great recipes for me to try and healthy too for me and my family,5
Not what I expected,2
"I don't cook at home all of the time, so this magazine isn't really for me.  I love Rachael's ideas but am a picky eater so most of her recipes I wouldn't try.  That's just me.",3
"Rachael Ray Every Day magazine
I love this magazine and will recommend it to others.",5
dissapointed in recipes,2
OK recipes.,3
Extremely disappointed. The magazine is all ads,1
"It was a Christmas gift to my sister, she enjoyed.",4
Made a great gift and very affordable!,5
Love Rachael Ray. So MN any recipes to choose from,5
"A great magazine full of recipes, ideas and information!!!",5
I love Rachel but her magazine is more advertisements than anything.  I won't be renewing.,3
"Have always loved Rachel and her cooking show, tried several of the recipes! A hit in my book! As always thanks from my kitchen to yours!",5
Great for good recipes and and products.,4
"Not much substance, but some good recipes to try.",3
Love finding magazines that I like at great prices!  Rachael always has several recipes that I tear out to try later!,5
"Company was great to cancel our subscription, but this was short on engaging content and long on useless ads",2
It is great! I love the recipes that are included. I will renew my subscription.,5
"Got this on a 5$ deal and we love it, comes with inspiring recipes, was delivered on time. We love it.",5
"I love magazines, but this is not my favorite.  I find very few recipes I actually want to try at home.",3
Too many ads!,3
where's is my kindle magazine?,1
"There are not many actual recipes, mostly ads.  A lot of recipes call for things that can't be found easily or are expensive ingredients.",2
Love this magazine!! Love Rachael Ray!!,5
Poorly organized,1
too much advertising not what I expected.,2
Delivered as advertised.  VERY Happy!!,5
Not a great magazine.  There are other food magazines which are better.,2
Nice magizines. Plenty of interesting  articles .,4
"Love this magazine, and the EASE of management of my subscriptions through Amazon!",5
I love this magazine !,5
"Ordered as a gift for someone who doesn't need 'stuff'
She loves it, loves the articles, loves the recipes.",4
i like it,4
Best Price,5
Great Price - Love Rachael's Mag!,5
"Not much better than simply finding a blog on the internet. Beautiful pictures, but the articles are much too brief. It's sort of the ""readers digest"" of archaeology, I think.",3
This is one of the best publications on the study of ancient culture. This is the best way to keep on the latest discoveries.,5
i love this magazine. it keeps me abreast of the major finds in the world which i find interesting and informative.,5
Didn't get as much out of the first issue as I had hoped to.  We'll see what future issue offer.,3
Wonderful recipes in this publication.,5
I didn't mind the magazine. It had some good recipes. I stopped reading when I got to the Monsanto add. What a sell out.,1
Purchased this as a Christmas present for my boss and she loved it. She loves Rachel Ray and the price was definitely right. I will plan on doing this again as it was so easy.,5
I wouldnt buy ANYTHING from this woman after she has been free pr for Obama's healthcare bill aka Socialized medicine!,1
"I Love Rachael Ray and her cooking, The Magazine is a great publication",5
Not as impressed as I thought I was going to be.,3
favorite cooking magazine,5
The food looks great and is simple to make.  Rachel Ray makes recipes easy for anyone to follow.  And the food............,4
this is one of my favorite magazines so I couldn't pass up the one year subscription $5 price.  it's loaded with yummy recipes.,5
Have enjoyed now and then watching her show. Bought this for gift!  She always has good ideas and offer great recipes.,4
"I really am enjoying this magazine. There are many recipes that are excellent, easy to make with available ingredients. Also interesting articles on fashion.",4
"too much advertising and not enough content.  was hoping for more recipes,  not ads.  this is like oprahs mag....  25% legit content and 75% ads.",2
I DID BOOKMARK A FEW PAGES FOR FUTURE REFERENCE - BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF ADS - I'M NOT SURE YET IF I WILL CONTINUE MY SUBSCRIPTION,3
I like Every Day wiith Rachel Ray because each issue is filled with so many food ideas that I always come away with something new for my repertoire.,5

Very good food magazine. My daughter and son-in-law also enjoyed the magazine. Gave them a subscription because they enjoyed it so much.,4
"I am very disappointed, I have not received my first copy yet...I am hopeful it will come soon...I KNOW i will LOVE the magazine...just waiting...",1
Every Day with Rachel Ray is one of my favorite cooking magazines. Her recipes are easy to follow and practical.  I have been subscribing to her mag for years.,5
"Lots of good stuff in this magazine.  I don't care for the off-the-wall recipes - I like the basics.  In fact, that's what I like about the magazine - is the basic stuff.",4
this is a great magazine i just love rachael ray and she has alot of recipes am very happy to be getting it every month,5
i am so glad that i ordered the everyday by rachael ray love everything about it inside and out.thank you very much karen c!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
didnt like the format overall...seemed like alot of ads but there isnt...its just how the mag is set up...too many thumbnail pics that are hard to see!,3
"I love Rachael and her show, her magazine is just as fun to read as she is to watch. Love it.",5
My boyfriend's idea of a joke...sent a year's subscription to me...not amused.,1
"Great price,  great magazine. Wife and I actually enjoy the readers true stories. Penthouse letters is another great read.  Enjoy life to the fullest",5
"On top of that penthouse tells me to contact amazon, amazon says to contact penthouse! I can't even file a claim to get reimbursed!!!!",1
This by far my favorite magazine!,5
I'm a urban homesteader that loves my chickens. This magazine gives great ideas on animal cruelty free was of raising your farm animals! I love their Chickens magazine as well!,5
Would be wonderful had I actually received it.,1
LOVE IT!!! Will keep renewing this subscription!,5
I love this publication. The articles are interesting and informative.,5
Don't know what I was expecting but this wasn't it. I am hoping the next issue is better.,3
Great Magazine has lots of information that will us go self-sufficient.,5
Good articles and info. Son is going to be farming family land and Info provided in articles will be helpful.,4
Definitely geared towards the softer sided/trendy type of hobby farmer but still has some useful articles and fun reads.  Helps pass a rainy day.  Lots of fall out ad cards.,4
It is interesting to read and has a lot of helpful information.,4
Interesting!,4
started out good will see after i get more copies to read,4
There are some good articles for everyone just not enough for me.,3
I've been a big fan of Hobby Farm for several years and I love receiving this magazine in my mailbox!,5
Love the magazine for its insight into the nuts and bolts of the rural lifestyle.  I expect to renew the subscription.,5
This is okay but I very much perfer Urban Farms instead.  This just doesn't seem as fun and informative to me.,3
I really read this publ. from cover to cover as soon as I get the magazine. I have to exert my authority to make my daughter let me read first as she loves it also.,5
"Just what I was looking for.  Small farming, how to pick and choose...everything, inspiring farming articles. I love the photography and information. Awesome!",5
Very nice / informative mag for a person that is not heavily into agriculture. But helps alot for the hobby farmer or country living folk,4
"We've written the publisher a few times and we still haven't received this
magazine even though they respond that its on the way!!",1
Great magazine full of insight and informative articles.  A must read for the diesel enthusiast.,5
I'm very pleased with the articles. It's a great read month after month and the ads are good also. Enjoy,4
"Great magazine, last of a breed of intelligent automotive journalism. If you enjoy Automobiles this is the magazine. Rest assured.",5
"Pretty Good Magazine, I guess I just prefer to drive the cars than read about them.  Of the big ones this is my favorite",4
"This mag has good photography and stories, for automotive enthusiasts. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading up on the latest motor trends.",4
"Automobile magazine is by far one of the best car magazines around, really glad I subscribed again to this one.",5
Been a subscriber for a long time and it's not what it used to be after ownership changed.,3
If your not an apple person or kindle then you are sh?t out of luck. Well I'm sticking to my Droid and I will forget you.,1
My only problem with it is that I can't keep the older editions when the new one comes out. I'm quite miffed about that. But the magazine itself is usually quite good.,3
If your into fast cars and all the latist news great magazine.,5
Ordered for my husband and he loves it!,5
Have ordered this for many years for my nephew...his favorite magazine.  Can't wait between issues.,5
"it's just not the same as the real magazine,yet it will do maybe it will improve over time.we'll just see",3
The only thing I was unhappy about with regard to this order is that I was not able to cancel it - I made this particular order in error.,1
I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. The magazine is interesting but it just is not what I thought it would be.,3
NO BOOBS !! articles are still ok!,3
"The new playboy is a joke,  they removed everything that made it funny and great. Do not waste your time or money I wish I hadn't.",1
I read it for the articles,4
"They brought ""partial"" nudity back...why so prudish?",1
Crap since they took nudity out.. DON'T waste your time.  Articles are and always have been pretty crappy..,1
This is not the Playboy you knew before. Horrible idea to remove the nudity and all the classic articles.,1
"never liked play bore lol it shows nothing i want to see on a woman's body
hustler and taboo are for me",1
Cancelled subscription a year early.  This publication has become a crappy magazine nowadays.,1
"I've been a subscriber for nearly 40 years, but will be letting my subscription expire.  The ""new"" Playboy is a total dud.",1
"New playboy sucks. No jokes, no nudes. Buy Maxim.",1
Got my subscription and halfway through they stopped showing nude models. Lame. It's like I got a half subscription at full price.,1
"The new playboy is terrible. I have been a reader for forty years, but no more. Shame on Playboy.",1
Used to be for men. Now just go buy maxim.,1
garbage.  they took a once great icon and turned it into left wing ding bat toilet paper,1
I used to save them now I throw them away the day I get them and will never renew after 50 years as a  reader and subscriber.  Hefner has lost his mind to allow this!!!!,1
So sad to bad see ya later. Not renewable anyone.,1
"Political correctness kills a great magazine.  Dull lifeless teens flashing.
50 Cent on the back cover selling Effen vodka!! really?!",1
The new format is terrible,1
"It's a huge disappointment.  No jokes, no cartoons, no titillating content, no reason to renew.",1
"Unfortunately, I canceled my subscription since they introduced the NEW version of Playboy. I didn't like it.",1
I am disappointed with the new format,2
I have been a subscriber for over 20 years. I just canceled my subscription. They have gone in the wrong direction; basically removing all of the fun from the magazine.,1
"The death of playboy.  The new playboy feels like they want to go out of business.  After 15 years, I cancelled my subscription.",1
"Just canceled subscription, which I have had since 1975. Playboy killed the magazine. Politically correct, my ass!",1
The new playboy sucks. I prefer on 50 years old to there new floormate.,1
worse I have seen in 40 years of getting the Playboy magazine.,1
"The ""new"" Playboy is an abject failure. I might as well subscribe to that lame and boring rag Esquire. At least it is a lot cheaper.",1
Hate the new format.,1
As a long term subscriber I cannot believe how they have destroyed the magazine. I will not renew.,1
Didn't realize how much of this magazine was ads. Some of the other features reek of sponsored content as well. Disappointed.,2
Playboy died,1
Canceled subscription once Playboy wussed out and removed actual pornography.,1
The new format is a sharp deviation from what made them great. I'll be canceling.,1
"False advertising, no more nudes, just another magazine with girls who now you'll never see naked. Way to lose your base PB.",1
0 stars.  As of the last March issue playboy is now a no nudity magazine.  They also removed the good jokes and comics.  Its now worthless.  Canceling my 10 year subscription.,1
New magazine has lost what it had going for it. It no longer stands apart from the others. Been a fan fot 40 plus years. Sorry to have to say goodbye.,1
I cancelled my subscription.  Google it to find the number. No more cartoons. No more of what I signed up for. What are they thinking?,1
I ordered this as a gift for a friend and he loves that his order is very discrete and comes to his mail box around the same time each month.,5
I dint buy this !,1
Only recieved 3 issues out of the year,1
"The magazines are invisible after the first two months. What a scam! And when you complain, no one responds! And then they tell you that you can't post a review!",1
Its a great deal.,5
Not as good as it used to be. Kind of disappointed in it to be truthful.,3
"what can I say? great magazine, great deal",5
Made my 85-year-old father-in-law smile.  I'm his favorite.  :),5
We have not received any issue!,1
"One of the Best prices I could find,delivery has been perfect.",5
"My parents canceled my order when they found it one in the mailbox, but still great articles ;)",4
Husbands happy :-) that's all that matters,5
did not order this,1
I got this as a gift for my brother for Christmas and he loved it!,5
Been getting it for over 54 years now.,5
Not what it used to be.,2
"I have been subscribed for over 6 years now and have never been let down! Love the pics, articles, interviews, and jokes! Love ya Hef!",5
"I have been a loyal subscriber for more than 10 years, if you want a great men's magazine amazon has one of the best prices.",5
"It's Playboy, a timeless magazine that I have been reading since a young lad.  I get it for the articles.",4
A Great magazine and at a perfect price.  Its definitely a buy if you are thinking about indulging your curiosity,5
"The magazine is over rated and not worth the money. I will not renue , will also cancel my amazon account.",1
"A Great Magazine for Men & Women with the Best in Humor, Cartoons, Jokes and Advice, with Incredible Articles and the World's Most Beautiful Women.",5
"more naked girls would be better
but the articles are decent and the cover spread is usually good
overall decent",3
I'm cancelling my order skinny women and every few articles to read I'm not impressed with Playboy any more don't like it,1
"I still haven't received an issue yet. Said the first issue was due on jan. 7th, it is now the 27th",1
"This is my wife's subscription. The magazine has great articles, seriously. The interviews are always great and in-depth. I love the jokes throughout.",5
"This is NOT an auto-renewal.  ORdered it once and although they said they couldn't charge it again, they did.  Cost me $200.",1
this is the mans magazine of the year in my eyes every man needs to have a subscription and love it,5
"playboy has great storys, great information and lets not forget  beautiful women. whats not to like a very classy magazine",4
"Bad taste, Penthouuse quality, improve your image, not sure why you would wnat to order such a low quality magazine.",1
"It's a magazine subscription, what's to say, it shows up on time, and every month, if you like it you do.",4
Too much time for first magazine and still waiting  !!!!! I hope it comes quickly. In the meantime patience ..........................,1
I still have yet to recieve my first issue.  I've recieved 2 of another magazine that I ordered at the same time.,1
"The magazine is fine but it took a long time for the first issue to ship and it was more expensive than if I had bought directly from Playboy, plus they offer gifts with purchase.",3
I tried to cancel the order 1 day after placing it. I had thought my subscription had run out when it really was just late. Totally impossible to cancel,1
I was offered several extra incentives(aditional gifts)after this purchase. I wished I would have had the more lucrative options before purchasing this subscription.,3
Got to me 2 months ahead of time. My daughter loves her first magazine. Ahe has never had any before so it was a nice surprise for her,5
for my great granddaughters.  will renew.,5
We love high 5!,5
Excellent read!!!,5
My grand children enjoy this magazine they are 2 and 4.  Have suscribed to this for many years for grandchildren till they reach 5.,4
"I bought this magazine for my 4 year old Granddaughter as a Christmas gift, she was thrilled with having mail come for her and she has really enjoyed the magazine.
Thank you.",4
had to cancel,1
my grandkids love it,5
Our granddaughter is thoroughly enjoying the magazine..... looks forward to getting it in the mail each month and loves the activities!,5
"my great granddaughter loves her magazine and anticipates each new arrival. She is 3+ and well into the magazine
and all it offers.",5
Great purchase for my 3 year old! We had a great time doing the picture search this afternoon and learned how to say HOLA!,5
"My 3 year old grandson loves the Highlights High Fives. He looks forward to the mail coming so he can ""read"" it with his Mom!",5
"I believe it's a little pricey for what you get. Not very many pages, but my granddaughter was thrilled to get her own mail.",3
"I'm waiting for this book for long! I didn't get the book and any messages from the seller.
want to know when I can get this item!! I purchased it more than a month ago!!",1
"MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES THIS MAGAZINE....
SHE CHECKS THE MAIL DAILY AND CANT WAIT FOR EACH ISSUE...",5
Dumbest magazine ever.  Sorry I ordered it,1
I like this magazine !!,4
Very informative and not much crap,4
I have tried many times to cancel my subscription. I do not have wi-fi anymore. I'm paying for nothing!!! HOW DO I GET AWAY????,1
I never could access the site.,1
Wonderful price for the auto renewal on US Weekly!  You can't beat it!,5
Was ordered by mistake. Couldn't find anyway to cancel,1
boring magazine but something to read on vacation,3
Was somewhat interesting,3
I Hated it!,1
Horrible . Waste of money,1
I love it. Great magazine and timely delivery. What's not to like?,5
This gossip rag is such a fun guilty pleasure to thumb through while on the treadmill.,4
I could only down load part of this magazine and noe i want to just cancel it completely,1
"Its okay, but not much content - mostly what was worn where by whom.  Not so much as ""what happened.""  Who did what.",3
I cancelled the subscription. Never read one word.,1
I really love this magazine!!!!!,5
WOULD NEVER DOWNLOAD TO MY KINDLE. WASTE OF MONEY.,1
Want to stop it,1
"Got it as a gift for my mother, and she seems to love it. The reason for the four stars is that it's very pricey!",4
Super bargain. The wife loves this magazine.,5
"Good mag- always entertaining and it takes a few hours to browse through, worth the buy- my only gripe is it
Is a little on the expensive side",4
"Very informative and gives more facts than rumors. Like that it is weekly, not monthly, so you can really get the latest",4
"I love this mag!! The pictures are great, the articles are interesting, I have no complaints! Thanks for providing me an opportunity to purchase for my kindle ap.",5
"it was okay, just nothing much to it.  I don't know if I'll buy it again soon, may try another magazine instead.",3
"This is a chick mag.  I am a bit of a celebrity trivia reader, but this was just fashion, and gossip crap.",1
"I haven't even gotten it yet, I see the new issue out but mines not here..very disapointed. I should have it by now.",1
I love this magazine...you can say I am addicted!  I only read the ones that I think are trustworthy with their information and this is definitely one of those!,5
My customers love this magazine and the gossip that comes with it. And it's a great price too! They go into withdrawals if I forget to get the lastest issues!,5
This is my favorite magazine. I am happy so far with the renewal.  I hope the renew will be added to my previous subscription.,5
If your wife likes this magazine this is the best present you can get her. It is so  easy and they love it.,5
Would not let me have access.  Media protected.  Waste of my money.  None of my books will let me gain access.,1
great deal---52 issues for under $34...can't beat that.  also the first issue came less than 30 days after i placed the order which was a plus!,4
I really wanted the advertised issue and didn't get it.  I spent 4$ for nothing thanks a lot. There is no excuse for this I just want my money back but it was just money wasted.,1
"I'm still waiting for the newest issue of US Weekly.  Some weeks the issue is fast, while others take awhile.  This is frustrating and should be fixed for a weekly magazine.",1
$6 for nothing!!! At least people give u the digital and paper magazine with us you never get new issues,1
"Received 2 issues today, hopefully they will be delivered in a timely fashion now.  The magazine is convienent and easy to read on the Kindle fire.",4
"great magazine, but there is no way to stop the subscription. I will disengage of Amazon...forever if this situation remains the same! Trust me!!!!",1
This is my favorite celeb magazine!  Much better to get it here and pay much less than at the checkout!,5
I wait every week to get this magazine in the mail.  I absolutely love to see who's wearing what and who's squabbling with who this week!  Definitely an awesome magazine!,5
My subscription came sooner than the date specified. Very happy with my decision to subscribe through amazon.  Best price I have ever seen anywhere!! Highly recommend.,5
My niece and daughter both got their magazines this week!  It was easy for me to use the EASY Amazon site,4
"I love this magazine...it has everything that I'm into:  The styles, the looks, the makeup, the celebs and more.. Great magazine..it's worth the money!!",5
Never ordered! I hope I wasn't charged!,1
"Buyer Beware!
Deserves zero stars.
Cosmo is a pornographic mag disguised as a women's publication.
Didn't know amazon was in the porn business ):",1
I love Cosmo. One of my favorite magazines since I was 21!,5
Not even worth the $1 per issue. Just same crap i read at 17 years old ,1
Love this magazine but had to wait a really long time until it shipped. I just received the magazines for Feb and March after ordering at the beginning of January,3
The article were Interesting the fashion ideas were helpfully,4
This mag is a total waste of paper. One month is just a copy of the previous month with a different cover,1
"#CosmoContainsPorn
#NoCosmoForKids",1
This magazine should be covered as any other pornographic magazine. Just the title of the articles can give you an idea of the vulgarity in it.,1
Love Cosmo! Always have and always will! I'm glad they've finally started to include articles for my gay guy friends!,5
Nobody likes your crap magazines.,1
"cancelled my subscription. The Magazine turned  in to a trashy tabloid Mag, writing a story to get clicks, by slamming good people  without checking facts.",1
I love Cosmo and to be able to get it on my tablet is awesome.,5
"Ripoff!  Will not download, then asks you to subscribe or buy the issue KINDLE UNLIMITED should not list this mag as part of the UNLIMITED  issues.",1
My wife loves them best birthday gift ever,5
"I am wondering if this is the whole magazine, the ones in the store are really thick this was about 1/4 size of the ones in the store",1
"Purchased this subscription and received 3 issues in one month, past issues. I feel ripped off.",1
Lousy not much to read boring.,2
The magazine came so quickly! I was very happy! The $5 for a year autorenewal deal was awesome.,5
I only got 1 issuse,1
This is 1/4 the size of the regular cosmo,1
not the same covers as at the grocery store. UGLY,1
Received 3 issues only sucked,1
Love!  Great price!,5
I love Cosmo!  It's by far the best womens magazine out there.,5
Mistake.  Not for me.,1
I have had this subscription for 10 years now and will continue to be a loyal customer...this is by far my favorite magazine,5
Having problems downloading to my device,1
Who doesn't love Cosmo???? Great read!,5
I don't am not a fan - nothing of real interest for me. However my daughter loves it. I will page through it when I have nothing to do but will not purchase it.,3
Love this magazine! Will keep this subscription for years to come.,5
"Used to be an OK mag, but now it's just trash, filled with ads.  Worse than ever.",1
Great magazine!!! I have loved it for years. :D,5
I love reading this magazine but lately everyone I buy an issue on my kindle it won't load properly.,1
What girl doesn't love Cosmo and a glass of wine! Have been reading this forever. Even caught my boyfriend reading it!,5
I've loved this mag. Since I was young. I love even more the e-reader version. No paper wasted!  I wish it did have a page selection. To go back and forth.,5
Maybe I'm getting too old for this magazine... I don't know (I'm 28). I feel like half the magazine is advertisements. It's just so-so.,3
Great price for cosmopolitan. Love it,5
I had hoped that the electronic version of Cosmo would have had more extra features. I was very disappointed.,2
"The magazine didn't really have anything to read during that month.
I like the actual magazine then the kindle version.",3
Did not order this. I hate magazines.,1
Teen girls STILL love this magazine!,5
"Cosmo is the best magazine ever! A great mix of fashion, sex and commentary.",5
Crappy articles. Tons of ads,1
"This magazine publishes the same thing. I think I probably only subscribed for a cute bag, most of the magazines went straight to the recycling bin.",2
Im so over Cosmo.... it is pure trash and not so much hair and make up.,1
my wife likes this magazine,4
Always loved this one!,5
Useless magazine. Too many ads. Disappointed.,1
Cancelled. Too much filth,1
good magazine!,4
Cosmo magazine.  Fun silly read with a little fashion mixed in.,4
"Horrible, It was nothing but ads. I am not impressed at all.",1
So tired of the same stuff in every issue...not worth the 5 bucks I spent!,1
"Awesome sex tips, funny stories, sexy pictures, great workouts, and a decent price for one! I loved using it on my amazon tablet!",5
"This was just put on my account, no notice or anything. I barely have time to read magazines and I just planned to let my subscription runout but they had other plans apparently.",1
"If you read one copy of Cosmo you've read them all. I didn't even get the 12 issues promised with the subscription price (I got 10, maybe 11).",1
"The magazine I ordered was very easy to purchase, I got it right away too! I did a lot of comparison with other sites, this was definitely the route to go!",5
"Easy to read and it saves the page for you. I love it, there are no problems for me. Highly recommend it",5
"Easy enyertainment for lazy days:) Articles about fashion, topic releveant for most women especially in the age 18 -30 , and some celebrity gossip",4
"I paid, I did not receive. I forgot about it. Too many ads anyways. I never received a single issue of the one year subscription",1
I would highly suggest Cosmo to anyone. I get it right to my doorstep every month and love it. Very good $ too.,5
"Perched cosmopolitan with visa, says on my orders that it is confirmed. Cosmopolitan did not show on my Kindle Fire. What went wrong? Please give me feed back. Or my money back?",1
Haven't gotten a single magazine yet. Not sure what is going on or even that I bought this. Little worries to see this,1
This magazine used to be a great read but now it seems to be all smut.  Really to not like it anymore.,2
Sex every single page. Seriously this magazine needs to arrive in a black bag because it is comparable to porn.,1
I love this magazine so much such a great one. I look forward to getting mine in the mail every month.,5
"Same crap inside every month and the fashion stinks. The products are all too expensive. There's nothing new inside, no new hairstyles, makeups, techniques; all old.",1
"I love my subscription to Cosmo! I get it on time every month. I love reading this again, It is so interesting and this is a great deal.",5
"I was not satisfied with this because I never even received a single magazine from this purchase, tried to report it twice nothing was done.",1
"I love copsmopolitan and would recommend it to anyone, but the kindle version seems to have many more ads compared to the paper version.",3
I got this one year subscription on sale for $5 and I am very happy with it. Getting it in the mail is a plus!,5
"I do not enjoy receiving the magazine after I already see it at the store. I thought if you ordered it in the mail, you will get it a little BEFORE all of the stores.",3
I ordered this subscription and never received even one issue. I don't even understand how it's possible that they could charge my Dad's card for it.,1
"I think it's geared more for the younger generation!  If you're in your twenties or thirties, it woud be great!",3
I love this magazine. And I received this year subscription for less then $15. Saving me a lot of money yearly! Always such good articles!!,5
every thing is fine  but who cares  16words?  please cancel my order  how about  please cancel mY order  cancel my order  i made the 16 word  DO YOU GET IT,1
Just wanted to renew the subscription and are now getting two at a time.  I guess I need to call and get this fixed.,1
i got a year of this for only 5 dollars what a deal it beats paing 4 dollars each month at the store,5
I really enjoy reading these magazines and it was very convenient on my kindle but I just cant justify paying the same price as for a physical copy.,4
This was a wonderful deal and an awesome magazine. I would get this again if the opportunity presented itself. It was the best price I had ever gotten on the magazine,5
Love love love Cosmo! This is such a great deal. You can't beat one year for $5 and an annual upgrade!,5
I never got it-!!!  now I want my money back but how . hate this carp trying to find where to go to be taken care of,1
Got this subscription from an amazon local deal. Probably not one of my better buys but gives me something to read if I get bored,3
"This is a good magazine for finding health and beauty products but it takes eons to skim through all of the ads to get to these articles, which is why I rated it 3 stars.",3
Cosmopolitan is an okay magazine not really interesting nothing that I would reccomend just to anyone but it is okay.,3
The first two magazines they sent me were ones i had purchased before I signed up for this subscription so that was a bummer,3
Excellent deal for $5 per year. I have read this magazine for many years. Now that I am nearing 50 it has begun to not appeal to me anymore. Definitly for the younger crowd 18-40.,4
"some good articles a lot of sex talk (it is COSMO) don't love it don't hate it I have read it off and on for many years. Enjoy Redbook,More and a few other",4
Was horrified to find this trashy mag in my mailbox. The maillady now thinks I read Cosmo. Ugh. Don't know where 2 yr sub. came from but I won't be paying for it.,1
I got this magazine subscription for super cheap and I'm so excited! It comes every month just like it is suppose to and I am really pleased with it.,5
I love this magazine!! I like the variety of articles from clothing to makeup and more! This is a great magazine!,5
Great price for cosmo mag. Great info and great advice topics. Love the pictures of clothes and where to get them. Also low cost alteratives to the real clothes.,4
It was raining the day my mag was delievered so it was a little wet. In the past I got mags and they came in a clear plastic bag. Prevents the mag from getting wet.,3
I have not received any issues yet.  I would like to know when I will get my first issue.  I've seen new ones on the newstand since I paid for my subscription.,1
I have not received any copies of the magazine yet... They are all out in stores. What's going on? Womp..,1
"I enjoyed Cosmopolitan when I was younger, and I can definately see now that it is for younger women. The magazine is fine, just not age appropriate for me anymore.",3
I'm happy with this magazine. Not my favorite but its for fun. It comes every month and goes right near the top of stack of magazines to read ;),4
Never ordered this product yet somehow my account was charged....not happy and cannot find a way to get ahold of anyone!!,1
I denied any renewal. I will not allow any auto renewal at any time. I have not OK'd any renewal. Your review system sucks,1
"LOVE IT! I've been reading Cosmo for years and it just gets better! I'm so glad my renewal started with the ""Adele"" issue!",5
"I never got the magazine in the mail.... And I would very much like to receive it, I ordered it over a month ago, so shouldn't it be here?",1
This was such a great deal on one of my favorite magazines!! Received my first issue within a month of placing my order as well as the next issue! Love Amazon,5
"Fast and inexpensive, love it.  Makes much more sense than to pay full price at the counter of some store.",5
$5 DOLLARS FOR A WHOLE YEAR! I love it. Received my first copy after two weeks. I recommended to everyone.,5
"I can't tell my story on here as it won't let me but Long story short, I didn't get the product I paid for and the customer service was absolute rubbish.",1
"Ordered June 9th, and no magazine yet. I've ordered direct way after this and received other titles already. No excuse not to have by now.",1
"I ordered this magazine on January 23, 2011.  As of May 2, 2011, I have yet to receive my first issue.  Very disappointed.",1
I really want to give them 0 stars. I have ordered my issue back in Jan and still have no received it. I have tried to contact the seller twice and still no answer.,1
I ordered this months ago and never received a thing ..... not the first time i've been screwed by amazon,1
"Great deal on Cosmopolitan magazine - $5 for a year subscription! Can't beat it! Thanks, Amazon for offering such awesome deals!",5
I purchased a year of Cosmo for my 18 year old niece! The price was amazing and I think it was one of her favorite gifts.,5
GReat deal on this subscription and I've had no problems with having them delivered or getting the right issues.,4
"I bought this as a gift and the 2nd issue was skipped!  Cosmo is Cosmo, so no surprises there.  Hope they get February's issue out.",3
Who doesn't love Cosmo!  Great articles and the price for the 1yr subsciption was great!,5
"I enjoy reading Cosmo, but couldn't see spending what others want for the subscription fee. This offer is unbeatable, so I had to buy it from you. Thank you!",4
Cosmo is my favorite magazine and at $5/year how can you go wrong? I love all of the articles and advice.,5
"Awesome, I mean I usually spend that much for one issue. You can't beat the price.",5
"Extremely quick response, wonderful value, nothing to complain about at all.

I plan to come back for any other subscriptions I need in the future, best deal on the web!",5
"I love this mag. I am 30 and I still read all the juicy info. The dealer was great, and had my info processed way before time suggested.",5
"Placed order 4 months ago and have only recieved 2 issues.  The first was not even a real Cosmo, so I guess I should say I have only recieved 1 issue.  Dont Waste your Money!",1
I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THIS MAGAZINE IN THE MAIL!  I PLACED THE ORDER IN JANUARY AND IT IS NOW MAY!  IT HAS BEEN 5 MONTHS AND NO MAGAZINE!  I WANT A REFUND!!,1
"This Mag is awesome! Lets just say it is very informative! (wink, wink). A must have for all lovebirds.",5
I was quite disappointed with how long it took to process this order - over 2 months.,1
still have not received any issues,1
"Informative articles with up to date information on the changing attitudes, laws and grow techniques for the up and coming marijuana markets.",4
"Really like the articles, and product reviews.",4
Problems receiving first issue,1
Still have not received the magazine? Tracking says High Times will arrive sometime next month? What's up w/that? Should have given that info. When I placed the order.,1
"If I could receive the magazine, I'd gladly rate it. I've been waiting close to a month and have yet to get one in the mail.",1
This is the best cooking magazine out there.,5
"THIS GEM OF A MAGAZINE IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE WITH GREAT RECIPES, EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS, WONDERFUL HINTS.
I TREASURE EACH ISSUE AND ACTUALLY HAVE SAVED THEM ALL.",5
Excited to read these!,4
"I Cant review this as I didn't order it , nor did I read it. (My 4yrold ordered it,  we deleted it before even realizing what it was)",1
"I love this magazine.
Great for young housewives. I have used to for 50 years . I learned how to cook and many other household ideas when I was a very young mother.",5
Received my first magazine and there was nothing I could use. A bit disappointed but maybe next month.,3
CANNOT DOWNLOAD MAGAZINES AS A PRIME MEMBER AS OF JAN.25.18!!,1
All advertising...awful.,1
Great magazine and great value,5
Didn't like magazine.  Too many ads. Not enough interesting content.,2
Lame. Inundated with advertising.,1
Just wanted halloween recipes not very many,2
digital won't work on kindle fire!!,1
great love this mag can't wait for the next  month,5
I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN THIS MAGAZINE TOO,1
Nothing but ads and repetitive crap articles... Complete waste of trees,1
Not worth it,1
Not gong to subscribe to any magazines any longer they are all the same.,1
Been reading for years - love it,5
I have always loved Family Circle!,5
all advertisments,1
This affordable magazine is one of my top favorites.,5
Great magazine that covers every subject.  I grew up on it and will always love FC!,5
I have been a user of Family Circle for many years and am glad to get it on Kindle no more piles of magazines in my living room.,4
"Really good, healthy recipes. I like the articles as well. Good value!",4
This magazine has changed a lot from when I would get it years ago...too many ads for my liking.,3
You can't go wrong with Family Circle! Great ideas!,5
"Wife loves it, has good projects.  One month had a great recipe for marshmallows that we've been using.  Done many variations of it, and still love it.",5
Pretty good magazine. Good enough that this was a renewal.,4
"We don't have kids anymore, I'm on a dairy-free diet, & we don't eat pork or shellfish so a lot of the recipes are not for us.",3
I like very much the information about cooking and decoration also how to care for your plants and extraordinary families,4
Just as good as the actual magazine with the benefit of downloading it when you want and my kids don't tear the pages!,4
"I get this magazine for the great information it has for my life.  It is extremely reasonably priced, just cant beat it.  One of the best!",5
never realized how many advertisements are in this magazine ..... and not that many articles.  decided i don't want to pay for the subscriptions.,1
"I like the recipes, although I wish they'd do more healthier ones. The home decor ideas are helpful. The pictures, especially of the gardens, are beautiful.",4
Good recipes and I have tried a few. Good ideas about decorating. A decent price for what the magazine contains.,4
"Great magazine, seems a little shorter than the paper copy. Love the recipes and new ideas though! I plan to cook a few of them soon!",4
I have not been able to open this magazine. What is the problem. I can not review if I don't get it.,1
It is OK. I like some of the recipes.  I would like to see some crocheting patterns and crafting ideas.,3
"Family Circle has always been Family read in my home!! Always full of great tips and recipes, and well put together.",5
It has various articles - a little bit of everything. I love the cooking section and recipes are great .,4
I like the articles and the recipies. I am Icelandic and live in Iceland and Family Circle connect me to the USA in a good way  ...and the price is good,4
"I love this magazine and it's even better delivered to my door! Love the articles and the recipes. I couldn't beat the great price, either!",5
"From the advertisement cover, I thought there would be more project related stuff in it.  There were too many advertisements in the magazine.",3
Great magazine love the recipes I tell all my friends that it is a good magazine to get if they need to get a good recipe,5
I feel like the magazine has about 90% advertisements; did not like it at all.  I learned very little.  Ms. Hunter,1
I love this magazine and have been reading it for almost 50 years. I remember when it cost 15 cents at the supermarket.,5
Enjoy reading this magazine. Has articles about everything.  Would buy this magazine. Good price.  Would like more recipes.  Keeps you up to date with local trends.,4
"One of the best magazines still on the market, been buying it for 30 years Love all the articles and especially  a lot of the recipes....Highly recommended!!",5
Too many ads and old worn out info - not worth it.  Can go through the magazine in a few minutes and then toss it.,2
I purchased a 1 year subscription in December 2012 for my Mom and she is now (April 2013) getting an invoice stating that she needs to renew.,1
"I have subscribed to FC for many years and had a fantastic renewal opportunity through FrugalGirls.com

Highly recommend this magazine and Frugal Girls - you'll love them!",5
"Great magazine. Full of fantastic articles, delicious recipes and helpful advice. Magazine began arriving to my home within 2 weeks of ordering.",5
The pages are so small that old eyes have a hard time . . . also you can't print out the recipes.,3
"There are way too many ads, but I do like some of the articles and recipes. More coupons would be nice.",3
I love this magazine for the colorful pictures of food that they have recipes for. The recipes are unique and a lot of fun for parties.,5
"Excellent magazine for the price. My first issue has some nice projects, ideas and really good recipes and hints. It really meets my expectations.",4
"This magazine is a classic for me.  Crafts and recipes galore and decorating ideas too!!
Always a favorite for me.",5
I love all the recipes in this magazine. I will continue to get this magazine for a long time to come.,5
"Family Circle has been one of my favorite magazines for many years and now my cousin's daughters love it, too!  They are always trying out the recipes for family get-togethers.",5
Unfortunately I didn't like the contents of the magazine . Pretty boring I got my first one yesterday and it's already in the trash ;-(,1
LOVE LOVE LOVE this magazine.  Has interesting and helpful articles.  Great recipes for any age.  Enjoy making things with grandchildren and nephew.,5
Could not tell if I was looking at a magazine or just a sales brochure for stuff.  Could not find any meaningful content in the publication. It sucks for a magazine.,1
This turned into a womens gossip magazine won't renew,1
I enjoy the magazine especially movie reviews andbook reviews.,4

So so magazine.  Perfect for a waiting room.,3
Entertainment Weekly will always met my expectations!  wonderful magazine,5
Each issue seems to have a limited scope - one or few topics or people - if you're not into that topic or person then pretty much the whole issue is a bust.,2
Sorry - just too much Conservatives and Trump bashing to support it.,1
"I have had a subscription to this magazine for years.  I enjoy the articles.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves television programs, movies and books.",4
i did not get it for some reason,1

Changed there formate.greared for younger reader. Not as good as it housed to be,3
"Nothing great about this magazine, the picture quality is terrible and the articles are so bad.",1

Love it and the price was amazing.,5
"Waste of money, much better ways to get your info",1
I was able to download this one time. After that it would download 1 percent and that's it.  I tried everything I could think of but nothing. Does not work.,1

Best Magazine EVER!!!!!! Will ALWAYS have a subscription!,5
Got charge higher for a year's subscription here than in their own website. EW will give you 2 years for 1 year here... [...],1
"Few articles or substance.  Why not merge with People and call it a day?
Zero interesting articles.....very little guidance or recommendations........
Will not renew",1
last year the magazine has more about the next tv series for the next season and the  series of summer season. Also last year the magazine has more articles about actors.,3
Has some great up to date information.,4
This magazine turned out not to be what I expected. ..but for the price I should not be surprised. Will not be renewing! !!,2

"Don't know why I get this magazine other than I'm kind of a celebrity ""voyeur."" It's fun to see current pics and updates of the people we see on TV and the big screen.",4
"Compared to another large name television semi-magazine, I found it boring, expected, and undeserving of such a high rating overall. Canceling my ""auto-renewal"". Just my opinion.",1
Boring read not interested in majority of articles,1

Been a subscriber for 3 years now.  It is the only subscription that I look foward to in the mail.,5
Spam. Once you sign up for anything from them - they start sending you 3-4 emails a day.,1
The best magazine for the money.,5
Purchased mail order subscription for children.  You broke their poor little hearts.  They looked in the mail every day and never received one issue.  Heartless and evil.,1
Nice magazine but very brief. Expensive for what received.,3
The black  case is fine but I wanted a blue one,3
I love this magazine! I read every issue from cover to cover and always learn something new (usually several somethings.),5
I subscribed to this magazine for my sons when they were young and now I get them for my grandsons.  Wonderful books.,5

Had a one year subscription.  Don't go to Catholic Church very often but it is a nice worship aid if you do.,4
I get this for my mom each year.  She loves it.,5
perfect to start or end your day  it is timely and to the point  this is my second year and I love to read and meditate on the prayers,5
This is a monthly subscription. Catholic daily devotional following daily Scriptures etc.  Also includes Beautiful writings and reflections by recent and past great writers,5
I bought this for my husband's birthday.  It's cheap entertainment.  He loves to read it.,5
whole magazine is cheap trash,1
I have been trying to cancel People magazine. I.do not want it again,1
Doesnt work well on Kindle because its basically photocopies of the magazine.,1
Will not purchase again. It's cheaper at other places.,1
They cancelled my attempt to subscribe.,1
Sorry...not happy with with People Magazine...too liberal for me and they turned me off when they slammed President Trump...they suck up to liberals big time...won't renew it.,1
Took an awful long time to renew,3
Will not download on my kindle.,1
I don't read this magazine.  I think people need to pay more attention to their own lives versus supporting those that are already in the spot lightl,1
"Love the magazine but its ridiculous to pay over $100 a year for a digital magazine.
I'll be canceling it after the 30 day free promo.",1
Love it! Subscription came earlier than originally expected.,5
awesome magazine...,5
expensive,3
I'm trying to download just ONE issue but I can't anymore for some reason.,1
I cannot get more than the one issue I already downloaded.  Have Prime reading free and the Kindle APP but I just kept being thrown to the annual subscription page.,1
Will never buy this magazine again,1
This will be the last time. The way too obvious political bias is more than we can support.,1
Won't download,1
My wife likes it.,4
love this magazine!!!!,5
I WAS CHARGED FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF ONLINE WHEN IT COMES FREE WITH MY PAID SUBSCRIPTION.  REALLY AGGRAVATES ME.,3
This is my favorite magazine!,5
to many adds  will cancel don't care for it,1
I was charged instantly. ..but the issue won't download.  Very disappointing.,1
It won't download,1
"Love people mag, my absolute favorite!",5
Always on top of latest in everything. A must have magazine.,5
I look forward to the magazine every week.,5
"Usually love reading People Magazine, but this issue is lacking a lot. Back to the drawing board for you all.",3
This magazine was ordered for my mother and she loves it!  It has lots of photos and stories she loves.  Well worth it!,5
Price is too high for the bleh stories.,3
Not worth the cost. Glitchy.,1
It's the best,5
Unable to link my already paid for paper subscription to my new kindle. Do not know if this is Amazon or people mag problem but this is very poor service,1
Great service. Great magazine for my salon. Love the auto sign up,5
Can't get this issue to download at all. Please help or refund.,1
Already having trouble with People and their billing department.  It's a nightmare!,1
Totally pointless to humanity.,1
Will not download and open on my kindle. Every other magazine and book I have purchased does.,1
stories and writing is solid but the content per magazine is a bit scant.,3
Convenient.  Like paying by the month.,4
The magazine is to expensive,1
Love too keep up with the stars!!!,5
Probably the least well written of all the hunting and fishing magazines on the market.,2
My Favorite Magazine!  :),5
was unable to read magazine it would not open only opened to shop advisor,1
Really enjoy the profiles and stories. My favorite is book and movie recommendations,5
Not the issue shown didn't want this one and no way to return :(,1
Takes forever to download.  Have not been able to open the download.  Have stopped purchasing the magazine .,1
Did not like. The people in the magazine are not worth writing about!,1
Never fully loaded. I found this was a major glitch on their free issues.,1
"I purchased a People Magazine through my Kindle Fire.  It would only load the first few pages.  I tarried several times, but was unable to receive any pat of the magazine.",1
Thumbs down,1
Photos and text look small in Kindle and they can not be enlarged. I deleted it and frankly I don't see use for it.,1
Love people magazine!,5
No for me to much junk I don't care for,1
I only got one issue (as planned) but it never downloaded past the table of contents,1
Could not download. Might be my server.,1
"EASY TO USE & READ, JUST LIKE A REGULAR MAGAZINE!!",4
"typing too small to read, cannot be enlarged like other mags......wont be buying too often, will buy other mags now",1
I can't get it on my ipad only my phone.  Will only be using the trial period.,1
Would like to cancel,1
I don't want this!  Please remove it!!!!!,1
The headlines and content are not always consistent. I cancelled two other subscription for this reason.,2
Just another dirt rag,1
It's alright for a gossip magazine,3
I love People Magazine because it always publishes everything that is important and all that I want to read about. I look forward to receiving it every week.,5
GREAT LOVED IT-WONDERFUL-SUPPER,5
I don't read this crap and I have no idea why I am being asked to review it.,1
It was ok ,3
"The reporting is fair and ""rumor-based"".  But I love all the photos.",3
Terrible.  It won't load the main stories. It says loading forever.  I let it sit overnight and it still never loaded.,1
Love the magazine and absolutely love the price!!,5
I have lost all past issues that I have not read and apparently last week's which I have not finish.  Kindle app bites!,1
Considering the magazine will not download even one star is too many. I will be calling for a full refund.,1
MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE NEWS STAND!!! GREAT DEAL!,5
"Not enough articles, just pictures",2
Fun to read.,4
Mostly irrelevant  rubbish,1
Just like having the magazine in your hand. No need to carry a stack. Great for any one on the go.,4
Why are the same people featured over and over again in these magazines? I'm tired of hearing of kim and her obvious plastic surgeries!,3
People requires you to have the print edition to have the digital edition.  I don't have the print edition so I could never read the digital edition.,1
I want my money back. I was sent a 2012 magazine.  Who wants to read old news?  This is ridiculous.,1
"If I could download the issue it may be great. But since I can't, it sucks. I want a refund for all magazines bouGht for kindle from amazon",1
reading a magazine on the ipad or kindle is a little strange for me.  i'll keep trying it but I think I'd prefer the real magazine.,3
Very uninteresting and a lot of nothing. I won't be buying this magazine anytime in the near future.  Seems like it was all ads.,1
This magazine worked well with my tablet and had lots of stories and good photos. It arrives in timely style every week.,4
I don't even remember ordering this magazine so I can not give it a review.  I am not interested in this couple or what they are doing.  I would remember ordering I am sure.,1
I was all excited to have a magazine on my Kindle but could not figure out how to read it.  Is there a way to enlarge the pages?,1
No need to review-we all know and love People magazine-an American institution!  We grew up with it and it never fails to get the best correct info!,5
Are you kidding me? Is this a false 'People magazine' marketer preying on people?  Outrageous pricing!!! Dont buy through this link.,1
I love this magazine.  It always has fun stories and games for my son.  He loves getting a magazine in the mail just for him.,5
Great gift for my niece. She loves it.,5
Didn't order.  Fire was hacked.,1
Bought this for a my nieces. Parents and children love it.,5
My grandson loves it,5
By far the best children's magazine brand around. I have 5 kids so I have tried almost everyone out there. Anything from this company is on point!,5
Good magazine.  Didnt really focus on what I was looking for. That is a magazine strictly about sports bikes but all around OK.,3
"Excellent magazine, glad I purchased. Has articles for beginners to pros, with a lot in between.",5
Very light reading. Maybe only 5-6 articles an issue. You get what you pay for,3
BEWARE!-Its NOT 12 issues as advertised. My last two issues were for DEC/JAN and FEB/MARCH. Cycle World doing the same.,3
Been reading it for a long time,4
"cannot read the print too small
I cannot do mags on kindle",1
Good book. Good price.,4
Hope the next issue will be better.  I was a bit disappointed with this issue.  Too much product review and not very interesting articles.,3
I have not received this magazine yet...and not sure why..its been a while since I placed the order...not happy,1
"There are many recipes, some interesting articles but, a significant amount of advertisements.",3
Good overall magazine.  Some helpful articles. I do look forward to reading it every month.,4
It cannot even compare to it's former self.  I have saved stacks of Women's Days from the 70s and 80s.  I will not save one of these issues - nothing worthwhile.,1
Very redundant from month to month...thought it would be more interesting but it literally just feels like every page is advertising something.,2
My mom loves these magazines and I had ordered them for her Mother's Day gift. I am very happy with the service we received and I know she is very happy as well!,5
Yes I love this magazine can't wait to get the rest of them,5
this magazine is not as good as it used to be,3
Always informative. Good recipes and lots of great tips and decorating ideas.bi have been a reader for a long time.,4
A whole lot of nothing.,1
"Been reading for 45 years love it,",5
Not happy with this magazine.  there were 17 adds for meds and so much advertisement.... not much interest here.  i would NOT order it again!,1
"I purchased this as a fundraiser...didn't realize it was a ""digital"" edition.  I don't care for it at all.  down $ 20",1
Very happy to be receiving this directly to my home. I love the magazine and having it delivered is so convenient.,5
Who could not love this magazine?,5
It's an OK magazine for the price. Good things in it but it isn't great  quick read and a few good recipes or ideas.,3
One of my favorite women's magazine. They always lots of good and great diy ideas,5
"Always is one of my  Fab's , interesting true stories of real people and the services, of entertainment.",5
Some of the best tips,5
I like Digital Photo magazine. It has many informative how to do articles. It also covers new equipment,4
Terrible rag. Did not renew.,1
Informative and well-written publication.  Very good articles and reviews.,4
cancelled. too much advertisement.,1
like this magazine a  lot,4
Wonderful magazine!!!,5
"Very informative and an excellent source for learning photography, gives the reader the opportunity to review the various lens and camera equipment, prior to shopping .",4
One of the best magazines I've read I've always loved it,5
awesome magzine,5
Photography magazines offer a great learning experience. This one is no exception. Even the advertising shows great photography.  These always arrived timely in great condition.,5
"I recomend it, the articles were interesting, relevant and inspiring, I will continue with the suscription  as soon as posible",4
I used to get this magazine years ago and liked it. Now it's all ads. Gone to pot. Very disappointed as I was giving it as a gift.,1
Decent magazine that has a few tips but most of the magazine is ads. The reviews are pretty good but nothing you couldn't find at [...],3
it was ok,3
More for the runabout owner ..,3
"magazine is okay, was sent old issues.",3
Love it.  Thank you.,5
I'm trying to give Woman's Day the benefit of the doubt......too many ads so far...not much reading.  Will have to see what other issues are like.,3
Great magazine and quick handling.  A great way to purchase.,5
Good magazine. Read it cover to cover each issue.,4
One of the best.,5
I found the print to small to read on my phone.  I was interested in the recipes but there was  a lot of  stuff including advertising that made magazine not interesting to me.,2
This magazine was just ok.,3
Trying to cancel this subscription.  Same every month--just different recipes.  Not much to it.,2
"They jacked-up the price on auto-renewal, and by a lot!",1
i remember this magazine being alot better 10 years ago... its not so great anymore... i won't be reviewing,3
I hadn't read Woman's Day in a while. I found the variety of topics interesting and enjoyable to read.,4
Good magazine at a good price. Fairly quick delivery. I would recommend it to anyone interested in lifestyle magazines. It is one of the few good ones left.,4
"Not much information, magazine is getting thinner every year. Not worth the price. What else can be said about it",2
It is certainly not the Women's Day that we purchase in the shops was not impressed just pages and pages of advertisements no stories,1
I love this magazine. lots and lots of great recipes and craft ideas. There are also a lot of self help information,5
Lots of great on useful information and tips.  I always find great things to clip and save from each magazine.,5
I love that this magazine has a little bit of everything in it. I especially love the recipes. They are always fantastic.,5
"Too many advertisements and I did NOT authorize a renewal, and yet it did it anyways. I wouldn't recommend this magazine",1
"womans day is not that great, but it definately is better than good housekeeping. its okay, nothing to write home about",3
"I like this magazine for the recipes. I want quick, great tasting, easy to prepare recipes.  Life is good when the family gets great taste and I get out of the kitchen.",4
This magazine is like reading the same thing over and over again every month. When is this magazine going to get some new material?,2
This was a gift to my wife for mothers' day. She wasn't a regular consumer of the mag but seems to enjoy it. Good buy!,4
Rehash of old recipes and household hints.  Would not read it even if it is given to me.  Waste of my time.,1
love everything about this magazine. it hit home to familys on food and budgeting! and wonderful food receipts that I plan on making,5
I am enjoying the articles about people and food in this magazine.  Can't beat it for the price.  Generally a great magazine.,4
I think magazine these days just have too many advertizements and so few other content to look at.  The ads in this magazine have too many also.,3
"I subscribed but don't know when a new issue is out. No ""automatic notification"" on my Kindle Fire. I plan to cancel. Too hard on my brain!",1
"Would rather have the magazine in my hands
Would not buy another magazine. Sorry just
did not enjoy it. just me!",1
"Seems well thoughtout and am looking forward to the next issue
We found some good recipies to try --always a plus",4
"Its ok. Wish it had alot of manufacturing coupons. Very thin magazine, too much advertizements! Better than other magines that I get",3
I have read this magazine since I was a teen....and at 40 I stil find it as good as it was back then!,4
Cheaper than buying it every month at the grocery store!  Can't wait to start receiving it by mail every month.,5
"If would have been nice if it was sent to the right address. It is showing where it should be shipped, but instead it came to me. This is a gift.",1
But I haven't received it yet since ordering it through you a long time ago!  I've never seen it take so long to get a subscription started.,1
I would reccomend this Woman's Day to my Mom and sisters.  Woman's Day has a variety of subjects that entertain you for hours.,4
"I'm still waiting for this item to arrive aT MY HOME. I should have gotten it by now, but can't rate something I don't have.",1
"I really like this magazine, but there are ads on every other page.....should print more stories and recipes, and cut back on the ads",2
"I love, love, love this magazine!  It never fails to disappoint me.  There is something for everyone in this publication!",5
Haven't received any magazines yet since renewal so have nothing to report.  Last year was pretty good with interesting articles and recipes.,3
"I was under the impression that this subscription came with an e-read option...IT DOES NOT!
 I wish I hadn't signed up for this as I don't read hard copy mags any longer.",1
"Hi everyone am Nicole, my Huzzy ordered this magazine for me, and I must say, its worth buying and reading, great price also, definitely no regrets!!!",5
"Great covers, insightful and well written articles!",4
I am a hardcore conservative but I find it to be a thoughtful and interesting read.  out!,4
Best writing around.  Much nicer companion than the New Yorker.,5
Had the article in it I wanted to read.,4
Suddenly the content moved from Centris to Left / Progressive and from unbiased truthful reporting to biased propaganda.  I canceled.,1
"It liberal, bias trash that belong in the garbage dump.",1
Thoughtful brilliant writing. Best of magazines.,5
Pay for ads..wtf,1
Any magazine that lets a blatant racist like Donald Trump on their cover doesn't deserve any subscriptions. Make America Smart Again.,1
"Very Unprofessional and unintelligent articles, with terrible layout display!",1
I am dumber for having looked at this.,1
"Lost, Do not purchase",1
I finally ordered this and enjoy reading it every month. Great articles that are wonderfully written.,5
"Always been an excellent, balanced, unbiased source of intelligent information.",5
"The Atlantic is very difficult tp read on Kindle

\\",1
A great journalistic periodical....timely Jewell.,5
"I bought this copy of Atlantic for an article I had heard about, on the subject of political correctness. The article was poorly written and quite shallow.",1
"Love the Atlantic, great writing and great subjects.  Enjoy each issue.",5
The best magazine on the market.,5
Best magazine I found so far.,5
I did not order and I don't want this on my kindle.  See that it is removed from my kindle and my charge card!,1
"Awesome magazine, I highly recommend this magazine to serious readers.",5
"Enjoyed the diversity of topics, and the well written articles.  Gave me pause for thought.  Look forward to the next issue.",4
The cover story is isn't even in it. Don't bother getting this as you will only end up exhausting yourself.,1
This magazine was a great Kindle read one afternoon with reading time!  The formatting for the kindle was also excellent.,5
This has got to be one of the poorest written magazines I have ever taken the time to read. Especially in kindle form.,1
I'm sure I'd rate this publication higher if I actually got it. I haven't received anything to date and have no idea how I can get the issues I subscribed to.,1
"Enjoyed some of the articles in Atlantic although not all we for me.
Not all articles were of interest to me. Well written.",3
Great writing by insightful and thought provoking people.  And now I can get it on my Kindle. I love this magazine.,5
I like articles about modern philosophy but I would like to get it more. Jurnal is focus at US. I would like to see more authors from Europe.,3
"I always enjoy the different perspectives of The Atlantic, I wish there would be more editions every year instead of ten.  I also enjoy the web page.",4
"The September issue has been out for a week or two, and still no kindle edition.  Definitely not ""auto-delivered wirelessly when the physical issue hits the newsstand.""",1
They will slam you with an unwanted subscription.,1
Awesome  ,5
"I like the magazine, would like to see a larger variety of dcor styles.  Most of the dcor is modern or industrial.",4
I haven't read magazines in a long time. I ordered this one as I am purchasing a new home and wanted ideas. So far the magazine seems a little short on that.,3
What can I say? One of the best decorating mags around.,5
Nice for inspiration but very high-end in terms of the products that are featured...,3
It is an OK magazine but will not reorder.,3
Great having the mag in line!,4
Cannot read it on my kindle.,1
Excellent Decor magazine !,5
"It's too high end for my needs. Everything is just too expensive. Very pretty, but not much use.",2
Dcor much too modern to suit my taste.,2
my lady loves this magazine,5
A lot of advertising.,3
unless you're rich and you could bring it all to life with your unlimited bank account..,1
I've never disliked a magazine more..even the paper so slick that it keeps falling out of my hands.,1
Love this magazine. So many great ideas abs pages of inspiration.  A must have! You won't be disappointed with this.,5
I Love all the ideas of home styling it has been a big help when decorating my house. Thank you,5
"I did not receive it!  If I did, where is it?  I subscribed to this magazine because I love all thing ""Elle.""",1
"this is a beautiful magazine.  Seems to be written for the rich and famous and their designers.  Enjoy the pics, but not very useful for the average, retired and downsized person.",3
The styles are a little too funky for me.  I like things that match more or use the same color palettes.,3
"This magazine was way overpriced.  It was not at all what I expected.  Huge disappointment.

Will not purchase a second time.",1
Fantastic trial price! There's always plenty of inspiration in the magazine. I appreciate the fast service when ordering magazines through this site.,5
"This magazine is by far my favorite home-decor subscription.  Decor ideas are out of the norm, without getting so far out that they can be implemented in almost anyone's home.",5
Love this magazine. Always reviews the latest trend and I can count on Elle to introduce new designers. Thank you.,5
I always enjoy receiving my Elle to check out all the hottest styles and home trends and decor - I love it,5
"Not what I thought I was buying. Too many advertisements. Pictures of people I don't know, no idea where to purchase items",2
This magazine has some very pretty pictures; that's all. I guess it works fine for people with money but It doesn't do anything for me.,3
"This magazine gives great ideas and inspiration for design and decor.
It is, by far my favorite decorating magazine ever!",5
I bought this for my niece who's in her twenties. She moved into a new apt and absolutely loves it!,5
There seems to be only pics in magazine.. no real articles and even the pics are not of interest to me.. . did not find it useful,1
"I received my first issue and it's just rubbish. It's relatively thin for a magazine, and it's just full of advertisement and hardly any contents.",1
"The magazine has great, up to date ideas for all parts of your house - inside and out!  Love it.",5
"Good decorating ideas; however a little fancy. The subscription is only 10 issues per year, however, so it seemed like each one took a little while to arrive",4
"Elle Decor - simply the best.  Wonderful, eclectic decor - sophisticated, original, beautiful, always.  Inspirational, thoughtful.  The best American decorating magazine.",5
"I won't be renewing. Lots of ads and extreme prices. Pretty pics and few good ideas, but will try House Beautiful next time.",3
If you are like me there is no such thing as too many decorating magazines.  I have subscribed to this one for years and it is well worth the price.,5
I love this magazine! I read it faithfully. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the issues are not long enough.,1
I only received one issue!!!!!!!! Then received a bill to renew!! Not Happy!!,1
Not a lot of content. OK for $5.00.,3
Nice articles and projects.  Many years ago I subscribed to the magazine.  I'm glad I did again..,4
"Started getting my magazines already! Loving them. Fab price as well. Lots of neat things, ideas and such inside. Def worth keeping.",5
"It is not the magazine of old.  So many advertisement
 No crafts like the old magazine had and just plain dissatisfied",2
"I remember years ago this magazine was my favorite. The pictures of country homes, the decorating. Articles of real country families. It's not what it was.",3
Good content .,4
I keep trying to get my subscription updated. I don't know if amazon is slow to contact Country Woman or if the magazine is. Meanwhile I'm still waiting.,1
"had seen the magazine inthe doctors office, So decided to order,. Very pleased. Liked the craft info thats in them",4
I enjoyed this issue very much and I am looking forward to seeing more.  Will probably purchase this for my daughter also.,4
"This publication only gives the TV schedule for prime time only, four hours.
Certainly does not include many channels.",1
Its ok. I expected more channels in the guide and didn't know it doesnt give you early hour guide.,3
"I love having the TV guide on my tablet, so handy",5
Did not like it and do not it renewed,1
Don't like this TV guide. Very hard to follow,1
its useless and I shouldn't have ordered it,1
"It's not a full.guide. It only shows evening prime time shows, not daytime for weekdays and weekends. Would not purchase again.",1
Waste of money. Doesn't have daytime listings or what shows are about. Can see the same thing online.,1
Do not use on the Kindle - wish I could delete it to free up space.,1
Was disappointed. Only gave TV listings from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM even on weekends.,1
"Abysmally designed, poorly presented, totally confusinguser-unfriendly. A total waste of my money.",1
Honestly it's 2018 who the everliving crap is buying this?,1
Very happy!  I love it!,5
Not enough content. Don't want to let me stop subscription.  Would not buy it again!,1
"Very disappointed with TV guide magazine. I don't know when it changed but it no longer lists complete TV programming,only prime time.
It should change it's name to TV News.",1
Love getting it online!,5
"I really wish they had daytime listings.  However, it is a great magazine",4
Good price and intestine articles clearer program grids,4
Wanted the magazine got the kindle version which I know I did not order since I didn't have a kindle .  Pretty disgusted,1
Miraculously the first issue arrived as my previous subscription ended so I am very happy.,5
A lot of handy information!,4
Love it! My kids are enjoying it!,5
An inexpensive and convenient way to read the TV Guide.,4
Love this magazine....been getting it for years and have no intention of stopping it!!,5
IPad version was worthless.,1
"I can not review this purchase yet, because I have not received a copy of the magazine as yet",1
This is a great addition to new vegetarians! My family loves to read this magazine and the recipes in it!,5
It was never on my kindle and the guide was no help for me.  It did not list daytime shows and I did not like the format.,1
I hate it,1
We aren't using it as much as we thought we would. Primetime schedule only; no day time.,3
Decent magazine but recipes aren't very healthy or easy.,3
Great Stories.,4
I love how many recipes come in the magazine.,5
Wonderful recipes and great articles.,5
Cancel please....to much advertising,1
not much that I've even made in this so I canceled it.,2
Mom loves it!,5
Useless to me without daytime info. I won't be renewing.,1
Good prime time TV guide!!!!! :),4
You cannot beat TV guide to know what is on the channels.  Been reading this for over 30 years.,5
It won't open in my Kindle.  I would like to receive printed copy.,1
I like the articles regarding the upcoming show.,4
Needs to have a page with channel codes.,3
"I DO NOT LIKE THE FORMAT, I THINK IT IS COMPLICATED AND SHOULD BE SPREAD OUT MORE AND NOT SO BUNDLED UP.  LIKE THE VERY OLD TV GUIDE USED TO BE",2
it is terribly limited. a real waste of money IMO.,1
"we garden, but even if not, the seasonal recipes in Vegetarian Times can't be beat.  They're all easy to make and beautifully photographed.  I save mine.",5
Very disappointed. The description of of product does not mention that only prime time is given. There isn't a full day of listings.,2
Love every issue. Can't be without. Look forward every week to the interesting stories.,5
I keep reordering my subscription because I love this magazine.,5
I needed to renew my TV Guide and this was a great price for a years worth.,5
Love TV Guide,5
"Yes, it's only prime time, but sometimes there are no listings at all, just feature stories. That's not what I bought it for",2
it was ok. Won't get again however.,3
"Some good content, lot of advertisements.",3
I love this magazine.  Especially when it gives towns to visit.,5
Was very disappointed with the magazine.  Had no information about any local programs. Will not order again.,1
I can not read the TV guide it is too small a print and will not order it again. I thought I was buying the print TV Guide.,1
"I find it a nice little read, but most of the recipes require so many off the wall (not in your average pantry) ingredients they will never get made.",3
I get this magazine for myself and my daughter.  We both love it.,5
nice for prime time but has nothing for daytime TV so not really what I wanted. Don't know if I will keep it.,3
I enjoy vegetarian dishes although I am not a vegetarian.  This magazine provides a selection of decent recipes each month without getting too preachy.,4
"The magazine has way too many ads. Most of the recipes use very exotic ingredients, such as hard-to-find spices. I am very disappointed.",2
"It's advertised as Print + Kindle. However, I am unable to get the Kindle version. Contacting Amazon did not help, as they are unwilling to honor the offer.",1
Doesn't always give correct shows in time slots.,3
"Very helpful & easy to read, but I wish they would print the day time shows.",4
I purchased this for my wife and she loves reading it. She watches for the next issue.,5
We love this magazine,5
we can't live without it,5
Very good recipes and info.  I like the easy referral chart in the back.  Thanks for a great useful magazine,4
Love the TV Guide.  Can't beat the price.,5
The recipies are nothing I would make. They are yukky and too difficult to make. Alot of the ingredients are difficult to find.,1
"If you live in the South or just love seeing the ideas - a must have.  Very useful, practicle design and recipe ideas.",5
Have always loved this magazine.,5
Does no have daytime listings and does not identify channel numbers by carrier.,2
The schedule is wrong as often as it is right. Total waste of money,1
Very disappointing.  Not like the original TV GUIDE.  No daily listings.  My 90 year old mom found it useless.,1
Nice magazine but pretty pricy,3
Always a great magazine and this was the best price around.,5
Great informative mag.  Wife loves it.,5
This was an excellent gift!,5
Love Southern Living,5
It's definitely not the magazine I read when I was living in Texas,1
"Best magazine out there for its kind, truly a keeper in so many ways!!",5
This is not the magazine it was years ago.  I would not subscribe if it was free.  Just something else to recycle.,1
"Very good, although wish started before 8PM in the day!",4
I Like the price,4
Was totally unable to download. Am reluctant to 're-order and be double billed,1
Excellent review / reading of upcoming TV shows! Now we're given the additional benefit of finding the edition on our tablets! Wow!!,5
Not the magazine that it use to be.  Not southern cooking.,2
I will subscribe to this magazine as long as I'm alive! It's a MUST read!,5
"I love Vegetarian Times - great recipes, relevant stories/articles, good stuff.  Its one of those subscriptions that I will have forever - its great!",5
I am not a vegetarian but love this magazine because it gives me different ideas for side dishes or if we do a meatless meal!,4
They ignored my request to cancel and  continue to deliver an unwanted item and billing me as well.,1
"Not as many recipes as I expected, but there were a few good vegetarian recipes.  First issue I received was geared a bit too much toward Vegan.",3
"a gift for my daughter,  She said the recipes look great and will try them in the near future. Thaks",4
"I think the TV guide should tell us what is on during the day and early morning, people work various shifts and not just evening.
Why is this??",3
We have been vegetarian for several years and found Vegetarian Times to be a valuable source of recipes and information.,4
i have not yet received  the subscription? how long does it take before it starts coming???? am still waiting for it to come,1
Bought as a gift for my wife. She loves it!,5
I have received the print copy but have not received the free kindle TV guide,1
Lots of beautiful photos in color.  My only question is: Where is the daytime programming?,4
"It was worthless, wasn't correct for my area.",1
Its so rare that I keep magazines around.  Every edition is filled with so many easy recipes that you just have to try.  Worth the money!,5
I have been subscribing to this magazine for years . It is my absolute favorite!,5
not complete enough,2
too mugh clutter,1
Totally disappointed. Want to cancel subscription. Only lists evening shows. Total rip off.  Not at all what I would expect from TV Guide.,1
Love Southern Living!,5
"A useless guide, only between 8pm and 10pm.
Shows only one PBS station, we have three.
Of the 84 pages only 28 devoted to station guiding.",1
Comes in hand to see what's available,4
Have only received 1 issue almost a month ago!,1
Awesome magazine! Always full of new recipe ideas and other great vegetarian info ! Look forward to my copy every month!,5
"First time ordering Southern Living.  Has many, many advertisements and a few recipes.  I am disappointed in this magazine.",2
I like this magazine and may reorder.,4
Who doesn't love Southern Living? This is the best!,5
Not enough local details.,2
Ok for a guide,3
A must have nowadays!,5
Nice to see what is coming on and background stories.,4
Nice magazine but would like a little more traditional look to it.,3
"Always loved SOUTHERN LIVING, even gave a subscription to my Daughter for years.....then the price went out of sight.....the offer I got on Amazon was well worth ordering again.",4
Great price....picked up right where my old subscription finished!,5
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to review a magazine in November that I was told I would not receive until December or January.,1
I love this magazine - my husband is vegan and I have found fabulous recipes.  I also love to see the wonderful pictures.,5
I love that I can open a magazine and EAT everything inside it. It's ALL vegetarian!! The recipes are clearly written out and the photos are incredible!,5
Too many ads and not enough actual articles and content,3
It has beautiful pictures and recipes. Enjoyed reading articles.,4
One of my all-time favorite magazines with great article and wonderful recipes.,5
Love this magazine.  This was my first time ordering a subscription from Amazon and I was very pleased with the speed of delivery.  Thanks!,5
I only gave this magazine the 4 out of 5 stars because I dislike the amount of advertisement vs information ratio included. It is still a great deal from Amazon!,4
I'm writing this on April 1st. and I orderd on Feburary 18th. Still haven't received an issue.,1
Gave this to both of my daughter in laws for Christmas.  They love it!,5
Excellent  Service .  I am very pleased.,5
Amazing photography! Great food ideas.,4
"I love this magazine and the recipes are the best, delicious!",5
this is my favorite magazine. October 2016 issue has wonderful recipes...,5
There are no channel #'s next to the programs and the programs start at 6 or 7 pm.  I am very dissapointed with the TV Guide and  won't re-order it.,1
The subscription process was easy ant the first issue came earlier than estimated .Price was half of a renewal,4
"I have not yet received a single issue of this magazine. I am still waiting, but I did see that the fees for the magazine went out of my card.
This is bad!",1
A must have......,5
Love this magazine.  Has great recipes and interesting articles.  This and VegNews are my favorite magazines.,5
"Love this magazine and Amazon is best place to buy it !,",5
It took a while to get going with the magazine. But my wife is pleased with it and will most likely continue her subscriptions,4
"Keeps getting worse, as do the shows on TV. Either get it at a great price or do not waste your $$$.",1
"One and a half month after ordering, I still do not have received the first issue.",1
Must be 60% Ads,1
My second favorite magazine. Full of wonderful fail proof recipes. This was a great buy,5
"Love to read about shows, programs, specials , and extra articles!",5
"Love everything about it , wonderful recipe's that are easy to make. All the other articles and pictures give me great idea's how to make things work at my house.",5
I love Southern Living magazine.  You can't beat the price through Amazon.  Being from the south it is such a joy to look through the recipes and look at the wonderful gardens.,5
I don't do print + kindle. the magazine is okay has good reading,3
Mom loves it..,5
My wife is a southern belle who now lives up north so she loves this magazine!,5
LOVE THS SOUTH AND THIS MAGAZINE!,5
"My favorite magazine!! You can't go wrong, even if you don't live in the South :)",5
"We did pay for it twice, and it only show evening programs.  We do not like this at all.",1
"Advertised as ""Print & Kindle"".  However only got the print copy and NOT the kindle copy",1
"It is great to have both print and kindle editions , and it was very easy to order it. The printed edition came when expected.",4
You can't beat this price for this subscription.  I love getting it on my kindle.,5
"Shortly after subscribing, they changed it from a weekly edition to biweekly.  Boo!!  I am asking for a refund.",1
Keep me subscribed! Great mag at a great price!,5
Only Prime Time listing.  Poor,2
"Its okay, but a bit boring.",3
Good articles. Easy to find what you're looking for.,4
"TV Guide continues to diminish the number of channels listed in its TV schedules. Almost worthless to me now.
More and more infomercials on TV shows.",2
The TV Guide is no longer a complete listing of the TV shows that are on the evening. It has become a useless publication and I will not my renew my subscription,1
I WAS GLAD TO FIND THE PRICING GOOD AGAIN THIS YEAR.  MY SISTER GETS A SUBSCRIPTION FROM YOU ALSO AND WE BOTH LOVE THE TV GUIDE,5
Totally unacceptable!!!!  I would like a refund to my account - This TV Guide doesn't display t-v shows except for 7 p.m.-11 pm-,1
Excellent magazine. We love getting a copy each month.,5
Excellent magazine.  WE love all things southern and miss not living in the south so this really helps!!!,5
"Waste of my money. Doesn't, even offer daytime listings  not even for weekends. I live in Mountain time zone but this guide is for
East coast central. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!",1
Only received one digital magazine.,1
Love Southern Living magazine,5
I don't like the small print! Will not RENEW!!!,1
"They don't have a listing for during the day, which is when I normally watch TV.  Disappointed, so I won't be renewing my subscription.",2
very happy with subscription and the pricing is great,5
"Waste of money, not for my region.",1
Good pictures and recipes but way to much advertising.,3
The only problem is that there is no information about the A.M. programming.,3
I find the listing of daily programs hard to read  on my iPad,3
Not not as much content as before,3
NEVER  got  one issue.  pjs,1
"One of the best magazines, hands down, and has been for decades",5
"A wonderful magazine for food, plants, and anything else you want to know about the South!",5
"I don't have the Kindle part, but it may not come on the Kinle Paperwhite.  Got the magazine last week for this weeks shows.",3
Our daily paper often differs from what is listed in TV Guide.  And  it's usually correct. Why is this?  I can't rely on the TV Guide listings.,3
"I have not received the kindle edition. So, as far as I'm concerned,  the purchase has not happened and I was ripped off.",1
length of time for renewal to kick in seems quite long given today's technology.  price isn't as reasonable either since we are paying more than last year.,3
"Never a problem with issues, when I renew through Amazon for the past three [3] years.  Highly recommend magazine renewals.",5
"Love Southern Living! I've been a subscriber for years. Decorating ideas, and recipes the best!",5
My favorite mag of all time.,5
I love this magazine.  I have been getting it for years.,5
"Always love Southern Living and now that you can get it digital, even better!  Recipes, gardening tips, travel and decorating ideas.",5
I tried to subscribe.  I never received anything but the first issue.  This does me no good.  What a waste!,1
Southern Living has been one of my most favorite magazines for years!,5
Have taken it for years and love it.,5
The  T V  Guide  is a nice  way to get stories about  T V  personalities.  However it is not worth the  retail price but is the price I paid,4
"It's not that I hate it...on the contrary, I love this magazine...but I don't remember ordering it and never received any copies if I did",1
"Love this magazine. It isn't all advertisement, and I truly learn something from every edition. Perfect recipes, too!",5
Beautiful magazine.  So true of the good ole South!,5
best magazine.,5
"Great magazine but as other reviews have said, the print is pretty small.",4
Favorite magazine of all times! But a little expensive.,4
This is my favorite leisure magazine for new recipes and garden tips....love it!,5
Still like the hard copy best but it's nice to carry my kindle edition in the car.,4
I still have not rec'd my subscription.....!,1
Maybe TV Guide should read its own reviews...definitely not what I was looking for.. I would not recommend it to my friends,1
great buy on an essential magazine for TV viewing.  I will auto-renew every year through Amazon.  Husband and I share it.,5
Great info  the only difficulty is the guide for shows itself is difficult to navigate. But I read it for everything besides the tv listings,4
Great articles.  Interesting read. Thanks the digital version for Android.,4
Exactly like the print magazine in every way. The magazine on the app can be read on or offline once downloaded. I love it!,5
i  like to read the tv guide  i can see whats showing on the dates ahead  thannks for the opportinnity to do that,4
"lots of good info, however it often involves shows or personalities I'm not familiar with and have little interest in.  It is an inexpensive way of tracking evening shows.",4
I wanted local broadcast stations did not have them at all. It did not give a list of local statos. I had recently movers to the state and did not have a clue about the stations,1
Did not wish to renew this subscription!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  delete it....stop the subscription..I like to order personally...like to make my own choices to renew,1
I Ordered this Mag for my mom as she couldn't afford it anymore. And she is very happy with it.,5
"The only text that can be enlarged for reading is the adds. The text for the articles is tiny, disappointing.",1
not at all what I thought it would be I did not like it sorry,1
"I don't want nto auto enew. It is no value to me. Please cancel it. it is a worhless magazine.

Sincerly John McKean",1
Can't live without my tv guide. Love the stories and love how easy it is to read the nights setup.,5
Not satisfied. Some good articles but wanted tv listings for 24 hours. No am listing very disappointing! Bought as gift not what the person I bought it for was looking for !,2
Fun reading but only shows prime time schedules would like better if it had a full days schedule.  Great price.,4
I love Southern Living! I have subscribed since the late 80s and loved every issue!,5
did not automatically renew - still waiting,1
"Often the listings are incorrect. In addition, there is no general daytime schedule for the weekdays or for the  weekend.",2
Love TV Guide. Great price. Can't be beat and let's me know when time to renew. Same price from last year was wonderful.,5
I just love what southern living magazine is all about. The wonderful stories to the awesome recipes.,5
"Not accurate, some shows play at times not listed.  Far too much advertising and B.S.
It's a good thing the price was low.",3
"I buy this yearly for my mother who depends on her TV for much of her entertainment.
I know she really enjoys it and is commenting on many of the articles.",4
"1. I cannot use my Kindle Touch for the subscription.
2. The paper subscription has not arrived yet and the time is counting even though it was not yet received.",1
I have received this magazine for many years and it helps me set up the DVR for the week. I circle the programs that I am going to program.,4
it is nothing but 7:00PM to 11:00PM. Is not worth the money!!! Don't waste your money or your time on this item!!!,1
"I ordered a large print version of TV Guide and when it came, it was not large print.  I am dissatisfied.",1
I don't like it because it has. Only prime time and no daytime guide. I like having all daytime also.,1
"I was very disappointed. More than half  of the magazine would not download after waiting for 24 hours. I cancelled the subscription .
.
.",1
This magazine is nothing but adds and hardly any TV programing information. You call two hours a day from 8-10 of nightly programs tv information?,1
I love Southern Living.  It's not quite what it used to be but it has gotten some better.  Will always love reading it for recipes and vacation ideas.,4
The best magazine out there.,5
I can't get it to open so it's useless to me.,1
One of the best magazines I've read! It took me a couple of hours to read through the entire magazine since I didn't want to miss a thing. This is a keeper!,5
"I love Southern Living, and am a southern girl. What is there not to love? It is a part of myself.",5
"Best magazine ever!!  Love, love the recipes!  Thank you Southern Living! Have subscribed forever and never get rid is any of them.",5
One of my favorite magazines.  I always sit down within an hour of delivery to view the images and read the articles,5
This was a great deal.  I was very lucky that I found it.  TV Guide is my favorite magazine.  Thank you!,5
had to subscribe to a local one for information that was relevant to me in this local area of florida,1
Best ever for all cat owners,5
I would like it a lot better if it had a generic daytime schedule. It has a lot of interesting articles about listings.,4
The timeframe for us doesn't work ----- shows from 7 pm to 10 pm; no daytime shows.  But we do like to read the articles and the cheers and jeers.,3
I WAS NEVER WAS ABLE TO DOWNLOAD IT ON MY KINDLE..  YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE.. CAN SOMEONE PHONE ME AND TELL ME HOW?  203 464 2165,1
"I'm just taking my chances with finding something on TV.  Subscription process was ridiculously complex, tried three times to get it started and never happened.",1
I thought that it would have the morning listings.  I would like to see Saturday and Sunday mornings listed in the TV guide.,3
I love to read about the opportunities for travel in the south. We use the reviews to pick places and restaurants to visit.,5
i JUST RECEIVED THIS YESTERDAY SO HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF TIME TO READ.  LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE FINE.,3
I would rather have less celebrity coverage and 24 hour TV listings.  I also miss the Movie Guide they had years ago!,3
"I just receive my first magazine of catser and find it very interesting , I am looking forward for next month magazine",4
For my mom and she loves it,5
Paid too much for Guide. Others have lower prices for the same subscription.  Should have does additional shopping.  Guide is as advertised.,3
"What a great deal, the print version and digital on kindle fire.  Glad I found this and the price was great.",5
"I love this magazine,  especially the recipes,  gardening tips and home design.  I've subscribed to it for years and am glad to have access to it on my kindle.",5
This is one of my favorite magazines. The photography is beautiful. The articles are interesting and well written. I love how the Southern esthetic can be used in upstate NY.,5
"Loving this! A friend told me about it, so I just had to get my own subscription!",5
Excellent product and transaction!!!,5
Gift for my niece who is a cat fanatic - she loves it.  Thanks for the great deal!,5
"The main reason I wanted TV Guide was to get advance notice as to when TV shows would be coming on.  TV Guide is not very accurate on this especially on their ""double"" issues.",3
every week my tv guide arrives late.  if this continues I will cancel my order and just buy it at the local market.,2
I anxiously await the delivery of each new TV Guide.  I mark the shows I want to watch for the week or two and I love the Puzzles too.  Fun magazine and one of my favorites.,5
"Ordered Nov. 14 & have still not recieved my first isse-1 1/2 months ,are you kidding me. I could see 3 weeks maybe.",1
I haven't received my first issue yet but I saw a copy and it'll do. I just wish they had daytime listings,3
"This and Dogster magazine are both great. Catster has everything cat related...articles, toys, product recommendations, fun stuff.",5
OK articles. Should contain more  information on specific breeds.,3
You Can't Rely On The Information In It .And I Had To Go Through 68 Pages Before I Got To The Schedule The Schedule Only Covers 8-11PM Events.,2
How long does it take to update my subscription?  This is taking a very long time to update my subscription.,1
I also have not received my TV Guide.  Bought it for my husband as one of his Christmas gifts.  Oh well.....lesson learned.,1
"Great recipes and location reviews. Highly recommended. Also, great gardening tips. One of the best magazines out there. Always current.",5
My wife and My mother have been reading and living Southern Living for years. I get to enjoy the great food.,5
"I did not start getting it yet, taking a long time, hope I start getting it soon, looking for it to start",1
Hard to use. Poorly set up and not as good as what the newpaper puts out. I guess I wanted someting like the guide used to be.,2
"I ordered this for my 7 year old, and he loves this magazine. He gets so excited every time a new issue arrives. Great for anyone who loves cats.",5
Southern Living - what is not to love about food from the South and other interesting things happening in and around the South.,5
I subscribed for years but doesn't live up to its name anymore.  Very limited television show listings - covers prime time only and limited channels.  Not very useful.,1
We are cat lovers and thoroughly enjoy the magazine.  We read every article in every issue really love them.  There is always something new to learn and something to laugh at.,5
Only gotten two or three magazines and that's it. I paid for a year not a month. What's the deal?????,1
"This magazine covers everything I'm about ... Gardening, my home decor and some of the best recipes around. we keep ours around forever.",5
I like paying money to look at adds for products. I think these publications would be free. I guess we all like to be taken.,3
I LOVE CATS,5
It took them ages to come out with a digital edition and then to only be on the Kindle Fire and iOS (the second most popular mobile OS). Fail.,1
"After shopping the web thoroughly as I always do when purchasing anything on line, Amazon was found to have the best price, simple as that.",5
"Guess Im not waiting that long to get it. I understand that it has lost its appeal, never change a good thing!",1
gift - they love it,5
My Southern Living  arrived quickly. Wonderful value for those of us who love Southern Living. Everyone have a Blessed Day.,5
"This is one magazine I simply can't live without.  Great places to go, wonderful decorating, recipes to save and the gardening is my favorite.",5
TV Guide is only available in Kindle Fire.  It would be nice if I could get it on my Kindle 3.  What a shame.,1
I love cats!  I love Catster!  I was able to snag this magazine at an amazing price!  I look forward to receiving my issues of this magazine!!!,5
Great buy !!!,4
Thanks for offering such a great deal. I couldn't pass this up. If and when I am close to the end of this subscription I hope I can get this deal again.,5
"Good recipes, great picturers, good magazine for the price, have shared these all with friends and family and they have enjoyed them too!",4
"Interesting
Enjoyable",4
I am a transplanted northerner and I absolutely love getting my Southern Living magazine every month. The lay-out is fantastic and the recipes are yummy !,5
I have never been disappointed with any receipt I have tried. Southern Living always has interesting decorating ideas and shopping articles. Great buy from Amazon.,5
I went to the TV Guide website directly and paid $16.50 for 56 issues!!  How can you charge $39.95??  Not good.,1
"Want to cancel this order within 3 hours of placing it.
Told I CAN NOT cancel.
WHY NOT?????",1
I ordered the tv guide on October 10th.  It is November 20th and I have yet to receive the product.,1
"Love this magazine.  Bought gift subscription for sister also.  Has useful articles on health, feeding and caring for your cat.",5
I have not yet received this item!!!!  It was ordered almost two months ago and yet to receive a copy!,1
If you love cats you will love this magazine!,5
I love reading a lot of information I would have never known,5
"Good magazine I enjoy its travel, food, and decorating information. I like Garden and Gun a little better but they are booth great magazines about what is good in the south.",4
Why have I not rec'd this product?  When will I rec this item.  This is a great magazine but what happened?????,1
"Although I purchased Southern Living magazne (which I do love) @ the end of December 2009, it is now the middle of February and I have still yet to receive my 1st issue!",1
I love this magazine and it was so easy to order it through Amazon - and the Amazon offer was a terrific price!,5
"I have been a Southern Living subscriber for several years, so I wanted to bless one of my daughter-in-laws with a subscription as well. Full of great recipes and gardening tips!",5
"Daughter-in-law loved this.  Great tips on decorating, cooking, recipes.  I did flip through one of her copies.  Would probably order another sub. for her,",4
Today is November 14 and we have yet to receive an issue or even an acknowledgement.,1
"My credit card was charged for the item on Aug 24, 2009 and I have not recieved the first issue as of Oct 9, 2009",1
I am looking forward to receiving the magazine and am surprised it hasn't been sent yet.  That is my only disappointment.,3
I have not received the magazine although I have already paid for it - hope to get it soon!!,1
I still haven't seen a magazine and I think I've been taken.  Don't waste your money on this vendor. It's a con.  I wish I could have given NO STARS.,1
I am a southern living customer from way back and really emjoy this magazine.  This was a really good deal,5
Have not received nagazine yet - waiting for first issue to be delivered.  But we are confident that the product will be well received.,1
"My favorite magazine ever,  Has food, planting ideas, house decorating ideas, house plans, book reviews.  A little of everything for the southerner.",5
"My review is that I can not yet have a review. I still have not received my subscription. I am familiar with the product and love it, but I should have received it by this time.",1
I guess cooking light means cooking yuk.  I haven't found one recipe in months that I would even bother to make.  Frankly they can't stop send this magazine soon enough.,1
Don't like it.,1
Most recipes too many ingredients and not low calorie. Also charged me another year without my request.,2
Great mag.  Love the easy recipes and photos!,5
was slightly disappointed in the first book i got..not enough about cooking that things that i would like.maybe the next one will be better,2
This was the best book I have ever read. It's very inspiring and eye opening. I loved it so much.,5
Love the different food genres,4
This is a wonderful magazine..I've cooked 3 recipes from it and will definitely make again...,5
Too many advertisements!!,2
"Redundant.  Once you have read 3 or 4, I have had enough!",1
it's okay,3
"As usual, one of the best cooking magazines.  Every page, every article is a treat!",5
"Good, healthy recipes.  I'm not disappointed!",4
Great recipes but not so much if you're a busy person. Most are too time consuming for me.,3
A lot of good recipes in it,4

"Excellent meals to prepare,  I enjoyed the magazine, it gave great recipes.",4

"Won't download on any of my devices - 2 Fires, Paperwhite, Kindle Keyboard, android phone or my computer. Waste of money",1
I love this magizine and have subscribed for years.,5
Love the recipes -- and the health information,4
repetitive recipes,2

Very nice.

Best regards,
S.Porter",4
"Good pricing - I believe this to be my third renewal.
P",4
did not not you up front it was an auto renewal not happy,1
They have very good recipes in here. I only wish they had more that were lower calorie/fat ones.,4
"I love the simplicity, variety, and all around deliciousness of the recipes. I enjoy the articles and the convenience of my online subscription.",5
I love that you can save recipes in My Recipes. No more cutting recipes out and forgetting where I put them.,5
This is a magazine that really gets shared. Everyone loves it.,5
"good magazine but alot of ads, seems like thats mostly what there is these days.",3
Every recipe I have tried has been terrific.,5
Love the magazine but hate the web site.,4
It is my favorite cooking magazine.,5
Never received.,1
Great recipes that include basic nutritional data so you can easily decide if a dish is right for you. Easy to navigate on Kindle Fire. Tablet bonuses are great.,4
I really like the idea of reading the magazine on my iPad. Don't have to worry about having magazines laying around.,4
It's great to have Cooking Light on my Kindle!  It's so much easier than using the magazine.  Less messy--don't you think!,5
can't see the whole magazine on my kindle.  some pages are black with a spinning circle promising a download that never arrives.,1
This is by far my favorite magazine.  The recipes are easy to follow and the articles are informative.  I learn so much every month.,5
Most of the recipes are easy to follow and do not require too many specialty ingredients. I enjoyed the magazine.,4
"i recommend  this magazine highly, I found a copy at  the gym where  i go and fell in love with it.",5
"i'm not renewing this subscription. the recipes all seem the same to me now. but, it's still a good magazine. i think i've just become bored with it.",3
I ordered this magazine for my daughter. The recipes are very easy to understand and use. The articles are interesting too.,4
I ordered this on 11/12/09.  Today is 2/03/10 aand I still have not received an issue.,1
I love this magazine! The recipes are the best! My family never knows what's for dinner because we never have the same thing.,5
I purchased this as a gift for a birthday.  I love this magazine and know it's a great gift for someone who loves to cook.,5
"Wonderful magazine!  These are keepers, which makes it a good deal whatever the price, but at this price, it's a gift giver too!",4
I've been a subscriber for many years.  The recipes make it easy to provide delicious food with nutritional balance.,4
"If you have a dog  or are interested in dogs, this magazine is very interesting full of ideas and nice pictures.",4
Not a lot of substantial canine articles but nevertheless it has interesting info.,3
great book for animal lovers,5
"Just like its predecessor, Dog Fancy, it's written to the dumbest audience.",3
I always look forward to getting this magazine. I read the articles from cover to cover. It is a great magazine for anyone who loves and owns dogs.,5
11.99 per month for Canadians?  How can this possibly be justified.  It makes no sense.  Is this simply a case of greed?  Anyone care to comment?,1
"Fun and informative! Great photography and connection with ""dog people (tail wagging)!",5
Every serious dog owner should read.,5
More ads than expected. But still fun to read.,4
"Slate does a poor job in sending content via Kindle. Stories repeat, and there is very poor organization.  This takes away several points.",2
very nice and informative magazine.  I passed it  on to a friend and she loved it,5
Got this as a gift for my daughter's boyfriend and he loves it. He's finding it very informative.,5
"Awful magazine. Too many ads, no articles. Went right in the trash.",1
cute and fun,4
It's just an OK magazine.  I would like more articles on treatments for ill pets and on how to keep them healthy.,3
Good magazine with interesting info and informative articles.  Only took away one star because it's so small and only 6 times per year.,4
I got it for my kids and thought there would be more photos but it's a lot of articles.  Great if that's what you're looking for.,3
Still a nice mag but I liked Dog Fancy better and I really miss Dog World.,4
Love Dogster for it's information and photos. I pass it on to other friends to read!  I recommend it for any dog lover.,5
"It's just a waste of money for the price, but I paid $20 for a year when I bought it a month ago so I just got ripped off.",1
I am so happy to have subscribed thru Amazon. The magazine delivery started in 2 weeks.,5
I love this magazine. It came before it said it was going to and it's a good price.,5
this magazine is excellent for planning. My first issue arrived damaged.,4
lots of adds,3
No real review i still haven't aeen this magazine even tho its been almost 3 months. So far ita a waste of money.,1
Good value.  Magazine has some good ideas for new brides.  Alot of dress advertisements but some of the articles are good.,4
"I'm not sure when porn became acceptable and specifically written for children, but in no way will my preteens or teens ever read this magazine.",1
Child porn issue - setting up kids for abuse - SICK,1
This magazine has nothing to offer healthy happy teenagers  It is a disgusting magazine.  Boring .,1
"An article on July 7, A TEEN MAGAZINE GIVING DETAILS ON HOW TO HAVE ANAL SEX. LOVE AMAZON. REALLY HOPE THEY STOP SELLING THIS MAGAZINE ""FOR TEENAGERS""",1
June issue teaching tweens how to have anal sex!  Definitely not appropriate for young teens.,1
"This is gross, gives children explicit advice about having anal sex. This magazines grooms children for sexual abuse.",1
This magazine is nothing more the ads and propaganda. Trying to reach our vulnerable children and teach them about secularism. Sick sick.,1
Nasty publication.,1
"They regularly run articles promoting, normalizing and facetiously advising on abortion for teenagers.  Not something I will EVER let a daughter read.",1
This was totally inappropriate for a young teenager. Articles about sex and female masturbation.,1
Disgusting and inappropriate content I would not put in front of my teen. Canceled.,1
Not at all appropriate for teens!!!!!!  I was absolutely shocked at the content!  I would NEVER allow our almost 13 daughter to read this magazine!!!!  Totally disappointed!,1
Crap magazine,1
All advertisements..no articles,2
girls love it,5
Nothing but ads.  My daughter really didn't like it at all.,1
"Bought for a 14 year old - she doesnt care for the mag. at all.  Too many ads, and fashion that is not realistic for young teens - cost and modesty too.",2
Not as good as Seventeen. Most product introduce/advertise in this magazine are towards to the higher end (upscale) market which most teen does not have the ability to purchase.,2
BOught for a family member she loves it,5
ordered this for my 13 year old daughter. she loves getting magazines in the mail. it so cute to watch her look at them,5
Would not recommend!  Very dissappointed in the magazine. I cancelled It.  It is all product advertisement. Good if you are looking for product choices.,1
this is a rip off i have the same magazine and i payed 20 bucks for magazines what a rip off gosh,1
"Bought this for my niece who loves fashion, she likes it and the clothes, has a lot of ads in it.",4
"I like the magazine, i just didn't got it on the mail... I paid for this 2 year teen vogue issues and got 5 of them (2 of them were repeated). Not happy.",1
"My daughter gets 17, and she enjoys its, but I like the Teen Vogue because it is a little less casual and a little classier.  With both publications, she is well balanced.",4
I can't believe people will buy this for their teenage girls as young as 12 & 13 & every other coveron the magazine talks about sex.  No way my child will be reading this trash.,1
I have not received the magazine yet and my daughter is pissed!,1
"If you like any off road magazines, this one is a must.  Great rock crawling coverage.  Nice and thick!",5
It must be VERY difficult to put a name on a list and put something in the mail.  I got two subscriptions via Amazon and neither has arrived yet.  Very frustrating.,1
This is one of the best magazines out there. The articles and advice are good. I really enjoy the jokes and the 10 Things You Don't Know About Women features every month.,4
This magazine has become way too precious for my tastes. I miss the really gritty fiction and raunchy humor.,3
"Garbage. All ads, all unrealistic fashions. Liberal hit pieces on Trump.",1
Very left wing biased publication. Not that that's a bad thing but I prefer middle of the road and didn't know this was such a politically biased magazine.,2
The best magazine on the market,5
Waste of time and paper.,1
Amazing magazine I will subscribe again for sure,5
Love the mag. Wish the online subscription was included like GQ.,4
Good product. Fast shipping.,4
"It was ok, not that great.",3
Meh!  Hardly any real men in this magazine.  They have a way of even taking a tough guy and just making him look like sulking prissy guy.,1
"The online magazine is very easy to read.  The articles are always interesting, and diversified.  I would highly recommend this format.",5
"I've been a Esquire reader over three years,when my subscription came due,this was a great price for a legendary magazine!",5
its been 3 months and I only got one issue,1
Esquire has lost some of it's standards over the years.  I feel it has lost some of it quality with very few interesting articles.,3
"Bar none, best writing of any current magazine and I'm a girl.",5
I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loved it! It was a great surprise for him! A good surprise that keeps on give all year round!,5
Bad format for kindle. Love the content still; no judgment on the magazine itself. I'll just buy the print copy.,1
Disappointed that it isn't full screen on my Fire HD. I typically have to zoom each page for comfortable reading,2
"I haven't receive any issues yet, though I've been looking. What's up ?  You are getting a bit pushy and confusing  se ya",1
there was supposed to be an email to the recipient to indicate this was a gift  -  did not happen,1
the magazine has some good articles but really does not suit me but I am 74 years old and perhaps not interested in much of the advertising and articles.,3
"There are some very good articles that make for an enjoyable read. Some are pretty in depth and provide an option to the daily news in newspapers, tv, etc.",4
Great magazine with lots of different articles. Very enjoyable and easy to read. Worth the money for a yearly subscription.,4
This magazine covers all the essentials of staying up with men's fashion and interesting subjects that fulfill our inquiring minds.,4
"better than most other choices out there
can be better but for now I like it
you will enjoy for once reading different magazine and this is one",4
"Some pretty good articles, some good fashion, easy reading before bed time.  And for that price, who gives a darn.",4
"this is a good ""mens"" magazine with a lot of good articles and fashion advice for men. The price very reasonable.",4
I ended up not reading it cause I found it hard to read on the kindle. I prefer good old magazines.,3
Just received my first issue...earlier than expected...enjoy this magazine much!  I like reading issues from a man's point of view.,4
there must be faster way to begin subscription - close to two months to recieve magazine subscription is not desirable to my taste.,1
I ordered the one year subscription (non auto-renewal).  I received four issues and then it stopped.  Okay...it was only eight bucks but this is bogus!,1
"If you read esquire you can't beat the renewal deal. Love this magazine its got it all girls, cars, fashion, stories, food, humor. You name it you got it.",5
"I ordered a subscription before Christmas and I still have not recieved the first issue. I guess I should cancel it? What say you, amazon staff???? Lame!!!",1
I just got my first issue and it was a great read from cover to cover. Highly recommended.,5
I just clicked on the free issue and without my consent Amazon took money for the whole year. There is no way you can desubscibe.,1
Horrible format,1
Value for money. Very informative lways current and upto date.,4
I cancelled this to Obama like for me,1
too expensive...sorry.,1
I have been billed but don't have the magazine on my Android tablet yet.  they are trying to help me.,1
"Poor articles and news, sorry
It's not just same for Time, also for Newsweek...",1
News I could used.  I just wish I had the time to read it,4
"You have got to be Kidding TIME MAGAZINE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
............ get with the program ..
 nope won't be buying the subscription as I planned to ...  .",1
do not suggest buying this for kindle paperwhite no pictures and confusing format.  I barely read it it was horrible.,1
Very difficult to read Time Magazine on Kindle. Very bad choice! I wouldnot recommend it to anyone at all. I regret my choice.,1
"I guess it takes getting used to handling the magazine on the Kindle, but I had some difficulty. Will see if I get better at it with the next issue.",3
"I like it and fouond it very interesting, but may change soon and catch up on my own country.
Aileen",4
"Althought there are not good images articles are good and easy to navigate, i am really considering to subscribe to the magazine",4
"I did not like the fact that it was only for my kindle and not my Kindle for my Android device, being a magazine it would've been nice to see it in a color device",1
"come on TIME magazine...i want to subscribe...but i have a kindle fire!  Available on all other types of kindles,,,how come not the fire?",1
This is really stupid. I can buy Time for Kindle for $2.99 a issue or subscribe for $1.99 a copy. Who is the idiot who decided that? This world is full of stupid people.,1
"Kindle or news stand edition, it's still a rag suitable only for the aluminum foil brigade or Obamamaniacs. May be useful if have a birdcage to line.",1
dont assume you are purchasing current weeks publication when buying a single issue. theres no way to check cover until its downloaded on your kindle and have paid for it.,1
"No pictures (some present), awkward table of content.  In all, very unpleasant to read in Kindle format.",1
too abbreviated. also no pics or charts. looks like Time did a very minimalist job on this project and made themselves look bad in the process.,1
I wish I would get my magazine. I've never received anything and its been like 6 weeks :(. Lame,1
nice book,3
Best guitar magazine available. Top notch articles and song transcriptions. Worth every peso!,5
Didn't even after complaint  put entire address on label so my son only got 1.thanks for wasting my money,1
Here we go again.  The subscription service is failing to deliver the magazine.  This happened happened before.  Otherwise a good magazine.,1
My husband loves this magazine.  He can't wait for it to arrive every month.  It is the first thing he reads when a new one comes in the mail.,5
I love the digital subscription. Now I can stay up to date on my musical interest's,5
Bought it in January and still wiating for the first issue....4 months for a magazine? If I suscribe through them I get that months issue in a week.,1
"Get this magazine if you like the latest gaming news, and the latest game demos. Well worth the price I paid for this.",5
"Don't know what happened or who to call, going on 7 weeks and still no magazine.",1
"I liked reading the articles, but found it difficult to follow the red, blue, and purple lines in the monochrome diagrams.  This would be excellent in a color system.",3
Tired of depressing news all the time?  Then this is for you.  Fresh new ideas and inventions.  I love it.  Something positive about our future.,5
"Nice exploration of current happening in Tech. Much more than Popular Science, but not as deep as Scientific American. I look forward to each issue",4
Is not for Hobbyst,1
Disappointing. Too general.,1
Doesn't seem to have the same (or all of the) articles I see in currents,3
So vain...,1
Mit tech review is one of the best glimpses into the future that one can get...excellently researched and written. Awesome!!!,5
I love this magazine and look forward to each new issue.  It is beautifully produced and the menus are lovely.,5
love the whole thing....and recipes!!!,5
"Ok, but I don't think I'll keep the subscriptions.",3
Love having a subscription to this beautifully made and inspiring magazine.  There are tons of recipes and decorating ideas.,5
"I love tea,and blending fruits and teas and other herbs together. This magazine is awesome!",5
Great magazine! Wonderful articles and recipes.,5
i just love it.,5
A must for anyone who loves tea and the art of entertaining!,5
I love Tea Time...best for social gatherings at home.....best for recipes and best for China and teas....like I said best magazine ever!!!!,5
I love having Tea Party's and this magazine has many great ideas. Can't wait for my first tea party with my granddaughters.,5
i love this magazine.  I especially love all of the recipes in it.  I enjoy it every month.  I highly suggest it,5
Not much content to this magazine. You really have to love tea in order to love this magazine. I like it for the table settings and a few recipes.,3
Best Magazine Ever For Men or Women!!!,5
Love G&G! Already pay for print and not going to double down for e_copy. Too bad they don't seem to offer subscribers free digital copies.,3
I was looking for a little more on gardening and guns.,3
Best magizine ever!!!,5
My favorite magazine. A must read if you live in and love the South.,5
G&G is my favorite magazine. If you are from the South or love the South this is a must.,5
"Love this magazine,",5
Our favorite magazine,5
Not sure as I have yet to receive a copy.  It is very hard to fairly judge a magazine or anything for that matter when not one magazine has arrived.,1
This is one of the best Southern magazines out there. It's a mixture of Oxford American and Southern Living. Not too much fluff and puff pieces. I highly recommend.,5
"I tried contacting them about no magazine being rceived, but there was no response.  They never sent me anything, They just kept my money.  Bob Benson",1
"This magazine is an excellent sampling of Southern delights, whether it be art, food, music, fashion... they have it covered.",5
I ordered this as a gift and it came to me instead. I contacted the publisher through amazon 3 times and still the problem wasn't solved.,1
"I ordered this magazine 8/3/09.
It is now 9/8/09.
I still have not received one issue of this magazine.
So I think even one star is inappropriate.
by the way,
Where's my magazine?",1
"Ilove
I love this magazine. It has the perfect blend of beauty products and fashion. The luxe for less is fantastic.",5
Decent magazine but can be expensive.,3
Always liked this magazine. when I worked in a salon.  Now I have my own.  I just wished they had more older women in it!,4
One of my very favorite magazines! Great deal too!,5
Interactive has to much trouble downloading...this magazine in kindle form just would never show many of the pages.,1
Better for younger women,3
"The magazine gives everything I'm looking for such as blogger style in all shapes and sizes, and street style. The blip app is an added plus.",4
"Well, for some reason I thought I was buying People, not style watch. But I actually enjoyed flipping thru it...so I'll keep it.",4
"I ordered this in early July, I received one issue and nothing since. DONT ORDER",1
I love the fashion.,5
thought i was purchasing people magazine.  nothing but advertizing,1
"Well, for some reason I thought I was buying People, not style watch.  But I actually enjoyed flipping thru it...so I'll keep it.",4
"Don't bother, only partially downloads & then stays in a ""waiting to download"" state.",1
Great magazine and great fashions. I like the fact that they also tell you where you can purchase them.,4
I love style watch print so I thought the kindle addition would be been better.. However I'm still waiting for the magazine to download since Friday.. Not happy..,1
"I have been a longtime subscriber and the print version usually takes forever to get to me.
Its nice having the kindle version for that reason!",4
I love this magazine. It's full of fashion tips and not cluttered with ads and articles. Straight forward and can't miss.,5
"This magazine is nothing but page after page of ads for overpriced clothes and accessories. I learn nothing, I am not inspired. Its a waste of money",1
"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. Unless you are strictly into what people are wearing, you won't find this magazine interesting. Cancelled after receiving 1st issue.",1
I actually love the magazine which is why I ordered but 2 months later......where is it?,1
"I was looking forward to this magazine.  However, it is well past the date I was given for delivery and I still have not received it.",1
"While my credit card was charged right away, I have never received an issue of this magazine. How about a refund?",1
I would love to review this as requested but I have not received the magazine.  It was ordered 11/30/09.  Today is 2/1/10.  Should I not have received the first magazine by now?,1
"I would love to review it, however I ordered it back in November and it's now the last day in January and it still is not here.",1
Have not received a copy of this yet and I ordered it almost two months ago!,1
I ordered this back in August and I have yet to receive my first issue. I didn't mean to rate this item as (I hate it). I wish I would have gotten it by now.,1
"The magazine itself is great. So far, it's been months and we've only received two. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",3
"No good. I subscribed to this in October, received one copy, and am now told it is unavailable.",1
High priced for a very thin paper flyer in my opinion.  This is not a bound magazine like a regular National Geographic is so I was a bit disappointed since the price is higher.,2
"Present for grandkids, who love it.",5
My granddaughter loves all of these National Geographic Little Kids books!!  I have them all!!  They are so colorful and informative!!  Love Love Love them!!!,5
"Great magazine. But should be named ""national geographic toddler"". Too simple for my 6 y.o. will be great like for 3-4 y.o.",3
"The magazine was fun, but I only received one issue",3
Would have absolutely loved !!this subscription had I kept getting it....I received 2 and haven't gotten another one!,1
"Small fold out, only a couple pages. Was looking for something a little bigger and solid for my 6 year old. This is like something you get at a restaurant.",3
Smaller than expected and very few pages.,2
My 3-year old grandson LOVED it.  He brought it to pre-school to read to his class at share time. Yeah! Its exactly what a Grammy wanted.,5
Nice layout; easy for little ones to go through. A few more pages would be welcomed.,4
We looked forward to each magazine. But had the whole thing done quickly. They're short.,4
"excellent, grandkids love this!",5
Got this for my niece for Christmas and she really loved getting something new to read in the mail. The only down side was that it took 8 weeks for it to start getting to her.,4
My child asks daily if he has a new magazine in the mail.  This is so awesome for a little nature lover.  Highly recommend.,5
Purchased for grand kids.  They love it !  That makes me happy.,5
Just right for kids from K-2.  Perfect size for a child to hold and flip through the pages of the magazine.  Great information and reading development.  Highly recommend.,5
Highly recommend for 6 year old and up.,5
Excellent kids magazine.,5
"Just ordered this for my granddaughter she loves animals, reading, books and learning so I know she will love this",5
my grandson and great-grandson both love this magazine.  This was a birthday gift for both of them and they both love it.,5
A great motivator for pre-schoolers and he loved receiving his own mail.  My grandson was doing book reports on the articles at 3 years old.,5
My son loves animals and is always so excited to see his special magazine and it gives us extra time together reading through it.,4
"my 4 & 5 yr old granddaughter love this magazine, order subscription for christmas and they are already coming. super fast",5
the nation is probably one of the poorist publications i have read to date.  do not waste your time on this .,1
after the editor of the nation came out for obama and had such negative remarks about clinton on larry king s program.....the nation will no longer be on my kindle.,1
The best there is!,5
"It's just screen shots of the magazine on the fire, not individual articles. I think I'd rather read it on paper....",3
disappointed,2
"I want to end the subscription, but can't see any way to do thatt. DON't BUY! You will be forever stuck.",1
That says it all.... It's ok.,3
"Still the very BEST, most vital, unbiased and truthful news publication in the United States!",5
"The Nation publishes well-written carefully thought-out articles about subjects one has a
responsibility to know more about. They are committed.",4
excellent reading at a great price. I found it very easy to read on my kindle keyboard device. No advertisements were a bonus,4
"Lenism displaced by about 100 years. What a waste; evidently the final ""soup kitchen"" for academia.

Odd that such ""mentality"" is still around after 1991.",1
"either you're into leftist claptrap, in which case welcome home, or you're not, in which case try Reason Magazine",1
Don't know can't download it. Not available. I would like to give you a review but I can't so 0 is it.,1
"Love the magazine, love the kindle version!",5
I love readers digest I have for years,5
Not too much that really interested me.,3
I enjoy reading the Readers Digest from front to back .,4
Quick read. Varied subjects and informative. Easy read!,4
Not as good as I thought.,3
I got this subscription many years ago. Stopped for awhile. Just ordered when I got my new paperwhite. Not much to it - would not recommend.,2
My all time favorite.  Best articles  good variety.,5
"best magazine out there , read it from cover to cover.",5
"It's OK, but I thought it would include graphics, pictures and the jokes!  Maybe it's been too long since I actually held the magazine in hand?",3
There is always something to learn from reading the variety of articles.,4
Interesting stories and diversions when your time is limited,4
it won't come up on my Kindle Fire. That's why I purchased it.,1
Very dissappointed Reader's digest isn't available on my Kindle fire. Does anyone have any idea why this id the case?,1
Reader's Digest has always a good magazine with relevant material.  It still is today and the Kindle version is just as good.  Very clean design.,4
"It's nice to get Reader's Digest on my Kindle, but the pictures are too blurry to see. You'd think technology today could do better!",3
I love it!  Just how I remember it from my younger years. Entertaining and informative and heartwarming stories. One of my favorites of all time!,5
Reading this on my paper white Kindle is great. I love the variety of articles in Readers Digest. I look forward to each issue.,5
"ITS FULL OF POSITIVE NEWS.NEVER A DULL ARTICLE.I READ IT FROM COVER TO COVER.I ENJOY ""EVERY DAY LIFE and HUMOR IN UNIFORM.",5
"In fact, with a subscription the printed version is cheaper than the pixel version.  Insane.  Also the Kindle version lacks the look of the print version, except for the cover.",1
"articles too short, hard to read on a kindle.  Information very simple I feel like this publication is now out of date with all we have available to us",2
"Not nearly as good a magazine as it used to be. I used to subscribe yearly, but it is no longer worth the money.",2
Just OK.  I kind of like the old fashioned magazine.  Doesn't have enough pictures and not very easy to navigate back and forth.,3
This wasn' the best reader digest that I have read so far there are some that I do like and some I don't.,2
To many ads otherwise it was pretty good. I like the non fiction and health articles The health articles that  have the ads to buy something is very annoying.,3
I just wish there was a way to see the Graphics on the app...but all in all - it is quite nice,4
I like the Kindle version better on the Kindle verses the book.  You do not have to deal with all of the advertisements.,3
"""This title is not available for customers from your location in: Europe""
If I want to pay for your magazine, why not let me do this?",1
Needs a lot more work. Be more like the paper print. I Feel like I am reading a rough draft. Add more POP.,3
I guess that I thought Readers Digest would follow page by page the published magazine and it didn't.  I found it hard to read and understand the format.,1
My only complaint has more to do with Kindle than Reader's Digest. I don't like not being able to bookmark my place.,4
I purchased this only to find out its not available on the kindle fire! Which seems a bit silly as the fire is the latest version of the kindle.,2
"i need to cancel this magazine asap. my problem is i'm on the road with no access to internet. kindle people, please read this!",1
"As a longtime reader of RD, I am upset that I have to pay for a digital subscription as well. This app should give me digital editions for free with an account number or password.",2
"It is January 2 and the December issue that I read back in November is the only current issue, although I am a monthly subscriber.",1
Why is a hard copy subscription $10/year and the e version 1.50/month.  Seems backwards to me. Shouldn't the e version be less expensive.  No mailing etc.,1
"Last issue in Nov 2010. Nothing in Dec, nothing (yet) in Jan 2011. This is not a monthly magazine, so why pay for it??? I cancel today",1
"Why is this product only available to the USA
I have and use Kindle on my iPad.
The Readers Digest as an App will not allow me to adjust my screen to my required settings.",1
"i had to ask 2 months ago. where is it?
finally delivered it. never got next issue.",1
"I have a subscription for the Digest, but for some strange reason, I have yet to receive January 2010.  I am not happy about this.",3
i love humor and gossip and this is not my type of magazine no way,1
Generally provides a wealth of information; but it is expensive,4
My elderly father loves this. This is an excellent magazine for the amateur sky watcher. Enough science to keep the mind stimulated and wonderful exciting photos of our universe.,5
Ordered for my son.  He loves astronomy and reads every issue.,5
"I love this magazine, it's a must have in my opinion. It has wonderful pictures and I love reading the articles.",5
I'm reading it on my kindle and it's difficult to get to different sections. That's my only complaint on the magazine,3
Good magazine but one draw back is that it is only available on my android phone should be able to see it in amazon cloud.,4
This was a gift for my dad..  It's his favorite magazine.  He has to read it from cover to cover.,5
Lots of good ideas for my husband's model railroad hobby. The layouts are interesting and the ideas have been great for his new passion.,4
I was not impressed with the magazine and deleted it from my kindle.  It gave me no new info.....,1
Love this magazine....love it,5
"A lot of advertisement, but the projects are great! Would definitely recommend for ideas for new projects. Four stars here.",4
"I am a beginner and I am finding all sorts of tricks and tips as well as the latest styles, beads and designs. I love it!!",5
"very good source for a beginning beader! articles are clear and easy to understand, would recommed  this magazine to friends",4
One of the best prices and longest length of the magazine prescription I could find. Great magazine for seed bead patterns and beading tips and pointers.,5
"Wonderful choice for me. This had alot of ideas & the instructions along with them. Very easy to follow. Looking for new ideas? Pick this magazine, you'll be glad you did!",5
Didn't like this.  It was dated and the patterns were old.  It felt like it was something from the 80's.  Not for me.,2
My beautiful granddaughter is on the cover!,5
Not thrilled with publication.,2
I ordered the magazine in April and it was scheduled to get here late June.  I never saw it. I was really looking forward to reading it too!,1
"Ordered 12/16/09, as of 02/12/10 (8 weeks)haven't received the firsts issue.  It's taking too long, if it gets here at all.",1
"A beautiful publication, filled with interesting articles and excellent photography.",5
I got only one magazine. That's it. Was sold a subscription.,1
Absolute best magazine available today.  I eagerly await each issue.,5
Too expensive!,1
This is my favorite magazine.,5
This magazine is always so beautiful. I'm always inspired by every page to apply these ideas to my decor and personal collections.,5
Beautiful magazine so inspiring,5
Terribly short on quantity. It's seemed like a very small leaflet. Not worth the $5.,1
My favorite!!,5
"Great pictures!! I would like to see more historic mansions , maybe a little history about them.",4
Great ideas for around my home! Simple ideas that I never would think of myself...,5
"Love this magazine. It brings me so much joy, from the floral arrangements, to visiting beautiful English Country sides, lovely people- it's all so refreshing!",5
"The pictures are beautiful! It is a relaxing and enjoyable getaway without leaving home.
I have the first issue and many years after. Love rereading them.",5
I love this magazine it has so many wonderful articles and so many beautiful pictures. It just adds beauty to my day and I find myself rereading it so many times.,5
One of my favorite magazines.  I'm trying to move to digital editions of my best-loved magazines because the paper ones have piled up.,5
"The information was excellent and well presented. However, the question answer format can get a bit tedious.",4
"Warning. Downloading from this site, and reading the material will cause your Kindle to become inoperable, or, at least in my case--more than once.",1
Not really that much information for a magazine.,3
Good source of useful information about a wide range of  motorcycle subjects.,4
Best motorcycle magazine ever,5
The best motorcycle magazine available.,5
Great magazine for motorcycle riders.,5
Best motorcycle mag ever printed.,5
Little content of interest to me.,2
I've only received two issues so far. Unless the future issues are a lot better I will not renew.,1
Have only received one issue and it's ok.,3
Not a very good magazine.  It is obvious why they don't have advertisers.  Who would advertise in a magazine this boring.,1
rather flimsy paper and was damaged in mail,1

"This magazine is so beautiful and sumptuous, I find myself wanting to jump into the pages and taking up residence.
Big A++",5
"Wonderful magazine, packed with beautiful photographs.",5
I love everything about this magazine from the high quality paper to the brilliant images to the lovely text. Well worth the cost of S&H to the U.S.,5
Have given this as a gift to several friends and family members and they all love it and ask that it be renewed each year.,5
"This is one of my favorite decorating magazines! There are always interesting articles
and great inspiration for designing your home.
Enjoy!",5
The magazine was in excellent shape and has so many great projects.,5
Colorful articles with clear instructions for above average do it yourselfers.,4
I pay for one year and I just receive one magazine. I disappointed.,1
Canceled my subscription,1
was looking for more,3
Disappointed not as good as earlier issues.topics not relevant to typical do it yourselferswill no subscribe,1
I love to read this time and time again.,5
So many advertisements. You are better off going on Pinterest than paying to have people sell you finished products in a DIY magazine.,2

"Lots of great and repeatable ideas.  Easy to follow instructions.  Not ""out-there"" ideas either, things I would actually do and use in my home.  Will buy again.",4
This is a neat magazine and a good issue with lots of ideas and projects to try.  Pictures help understand the project and let me decide which ones will work for me.,4

I have yet to receive an issue,1
"Great tips on saving money, but not so many coupons (there was only 5-7 coupons)",3
I still have not received my first issue and the price was not really much of a deal,1

This is by far 1 of my favorite magazines.  I usually read it front to back and an added treat is all the coupons that are in every issue.,5

I did not enjoy it.",1
how wonderful not to go out in ice and snow this winter for my daily newspaper.  i love my kindle!,5
He says no torture for isis but then advocates for torture of republican reps women and children.  The very definition of fake news.  Amazon should delist,1
Sucks  for libtards only,1
Sure misnamed with news in the title. What a pile of crap this rag is.,1
Totally USA centred. No use for Europeans or anyone else of the billions outside the USA to read.,1
"Biased News, used to like this mag but the turn to propaganda led me to cancel.",2
Not available on Kindle for the PC....,1
In depth news on today's topics,4
A favorite magazine for 45 years.,5
I cancelled the sub. Text way too small for a 8 in tablet.,1
Much easier to access now. Previously had older application that made reading difficult.,4
Avoid! only SOME SECTIONS of the magazine will be available in a Kindle. Not the whole magazine...,1
"Excellent content, and in the Kindle format to read is easier for me",5
"While I liked the magazine in print form, their online form takes forever to load and is extremely inconvenient to use. They need to improve usability.",1
"I do not like the digital version of Newsweek, not a bit.  It is not handy nor enjoyable at all",1
I've read similar issue articles in other publications.  Very disappointed that writer's opinion is forefront and central to the articles throughout the magazine.,2
I would not have bought the magazine had it been clear I was getting an abridged version. One UNHAPPY customer here.,1
The 14-day free trial seemed so easy until I realized that unsubscribing is a secret not told on the Kindle.  Am I doomed to receive this abreviated Newsweek forever?,1
"I have never received a single issue and nobody has solved my problem in the 9 months I have had my ""subscription"" with them.  Just save your money and avoid it.",1
Still a viable magazine but it lost its luster over the years. Not much for the format of the magazine and I miss Howard Phillips. And what's with all of the ads?,3
This is my 11 year old son's favorite magazine.  HE reads it cover to cover when it arrives and keeps it for review.  Love the extras (posters) that come sometimes too.,5
nice books,3
The App doesn't work.,1
"It is ok, but after my trial periods I will not continue. I have more than enough reading material.",3
PATHETIC. So many ads and the content is buzzfeed quality. I will not order again.,1
I am canceling my subscription because of how Anti Trump it is.,1
"I have ben a subscriber for over 10 years. The electronic version is terrible. More than 50% of the time cannot download on iPad. Don't subscribe, I will discontinue subscription.",1
"Information was ok, but not what I was hoping for, too much advertising",3
"So disgustingly liberal, I toss it right from my mailbox to the garbage can.",1
great deal - great news!!,5
"Fake positive reviews here, and I wonder when my 1-star comment can be shown and easy to find!",1
Value for money spent,3
Great Deal. Better than other offers I received.,5
I love the Amazon price.,5
"Excellent graphic design and well-written, concise stories.",5
Timely well written articles.,4
Have subscribed for a while. It's great,5
Keeps me current on domestic and world issues.,4
"Great coverage. However: most of the articles too long and windy (do they know their main focus group?).
More balanced standpoints than the old BW",4
good publication- very informative and unbiased,4
"It's a good read to catch up into financial news!
I would like more articles about Emerging Markets
E. D.-",4
This is a great resource for information which is about as even-handed as any news magazine and it covers lots of stories the rest of the mainstream press hasn't found yet.,4
If you want in depth bussiness news  ones a week it's very good. Less for not bussiness news.  Very American orientated,4
"Current issue has several pages which are illegible. This is of poor quality and hopefully can be corrected, or I will have to go back to the print/hard copy.",1
excellent business and economics magazine with little political bias.  In depth articles and has helped me to understand investing well.,4
i used to read and like businessweek before it became bloomberg busweek.articles are not well researched and lack in quality. i am cancelling my subscription.,1
"Wow no pictures,graphics come on bloomberg, and amazon make this app worthy of the kindle family. I also sad of the limits of this app,and publications.",2
"Kindle format is really boring. No illustration, table, chart, picture. Reading experience is very different from printed version. I have discontinued after 2 issues.",1
I don't like the fact that there is no pictures.  Take out at least 30% of enjoyment.  i will stay with print version,2
I like a  magazine that shows what is going on in the art world.  A lot of junk this year though.,4
"We are going on six weeks and grandson still has not received a copy of this subscription. Can't give a review at this date, but thought we would be receiving his magazine soon.",1
"More product or service advertisement than useful, interesting learning material. Reminds me why I read books, not magazines...",2
Love the practices and articles.,5
"Just developed an interest in yoga, and found this as a source.  Easy explanation of everything!",4
not useful,1
It seems like I'm missing the  January issue... i like yoga journal kindle version but want to receive what I paid for.,3
I am not interested in receive this,1
Great magazine! I recommend for everyone! They have really great articles and even show how to for the positions. really happy with this purchase.,5
Love the magazine...Great price from Amazon,5
"primarily, a bunch of advertizements.",2
I love the magazine. I had let the subscription lapse and really missed it. Glad to have it back.,5
Almost got me until I saw Auto Renewal.  If you have to make it hard for someone to drop your product it can't be good.,1
I love getting this every month! The tips and tricks have helped my practice.,5
"I do love the information that this magazine offers, however, it does have a lot of ads.",4
"Love this magazine, I always take out the pages with the poses on them and put them on a 3 ring binder!  I now have my own reference guide!",5
Didn't find it very informative.,2
I love this journal. It's the only one I renew.,5
"More materialistic than anything, not an accurate portrayal of the average yogis world. Needs more substance and less ads",3
"Super fast shipping! Great product, price and seller!",5
Bought this for my daughter as she teaches yoga.  She loves the magazine.  Great ideas and helpful hints.,5
"Getting a little tired of this magazine. Repeats of articles, and mostly ads..",3
Great online presence with important resources for building a yoga practice.,4
Very female centered.  Some articles for guys but few and far between.  I find their web page to be more informative to my practice.,3
"I like the articles in the magazine but there just aren't that many... Quite a lot of advertising, as is to be expected, I'm sure.",3
Love this magazine! Great tips and lots of gear showcased and great tips and exercises to practice.,5
"I love this magazine and having it on line is so helpful, without waiting for the mail and having it anywhere. It's great.",5
"No real articles, as others have posted, it's mostly advertisements.  I won't be renewing Yoga Magazine.  I got it for Mother's Day, and Mother isn't impressed.",1
"Very happy to be receiving Yoga Journal again!  It's always an excellent inspiration for me to try new poses and get back on my mat.

Michele",5
"Great value.  New practices, fantastic and well written articles that help me live my life mindfully. Learn more about your practice.",5
"It's all ads. There is barely anything to actually read :(. This is all about marketing not education and growth.
Disappointing",1
Love Yoga Journal and love that I can have it auto-renewed through Amazon and I never miss a magazine.  Great product and great service.,5
"Some tips, a useful article here and there, but then, do you really need it?  Just a bit less tree in the world, and how is that very zen?",3
Inspirational photos and articles. I want to get back into yoga and the instructional content is motivating. Plus the yoga fashions are great too.,4
"I do sync my Kindle, but it is always late getting it on my Kindle. It is out.everywhere and still nothing. Canceling my subscription.....not worth it.",1
I didn't sign up for automatic renewal. I don't like it.please remove me from this.mmmmm bbbb and the next ok,1
My kids love this magazine. They are yoga teachers so that should tell you something about the quality of the contents.,5
"I love this magazine great workouts,meditation, work shops,great food suggestions, alternate things for cleaning, food , organics, and many more encouraging things.",5
"This magazine is well structured, but not suitable for one of my limited physical abilities. It was a good sample to lead to my decision to unsubscribe.",3
"Informative articles aimed at the beginner. Ads, ads and more ads but they pay the bills. Worth subscribing to. Very Australian orientated.",4
I like the pics and the information provided. I would recommend the magazine. I especially liked the different ways it could be viewed on my kindle fire.,4
Good value for this magazine and saves me money. I don't have to shop for it in the grocery store or at the mall.,4
"Yoga poses, sequences, food advice, meditation advice, references for music, books, retreats, etc. I LOVE the journal and will be a subscriber for life.",5
I like this magazine a lot. As a student of yoga this is interesting to learn of other schools of thought and practice.,4
Would have been 5 stars but there are too many ads.  Otherwise i enjoy it and it has plenty to offer for some food for thought.,4
I would prefer not to have the auto-renewal feature.  It would be nicer to have the option or a reminder of renewal.,3
I do Hot Yoga. I thought some things might be the same or interesting. It is very different  it is great if you do regular yoga.,3
"Ordered it and paid for it in full, (two-year subscription) on January 6 as a gift for my wife. It is almost June and it's no deal from Deal Universe.",1
I ordered this item more than two months ago and have still not received an issue.,1
My 8 year old daughter just started getting this magazine. She really enjoys reading so the multiple short stories in the magazine are perfect for her.,4
My favorite periodical.  Beats the heck out of American versions.  Lots of content; little comparative advertising.  I look forward to it every time.  Worth the bucks.,5
"Love this magazine. Great ideas and articles,and great recipes too!",5
"My favorite  science magazine. Well researched, non ideological reporting.  Always something fascinating in every issue",5
Love this magazine and have for several years.,5
Excellent and informative content. I enjoyed reading all of the articles and I really love my Kindle version!,5

I already have The New Yorker Print & Digital subscription. Why do I need to pay again for a subscription on my Kindle Voyage?! Completely unacceptable.,1
Not working on the 6th generation Kindle Fire HD 8. Please fix.,1

And good luck finding out how to cancel or reverse charges. I wonder how many others have this charge lurking in their CC statements.,1

why. why. why.  tell me why?  we can not buy a book in china.  can it be changed?  is it very difficult in this area.  we will be very happy to buy in in this country.,1

Never again!",1
Not available in Australia either. You want my money or not?? We get the TLS Kindle version (great reading) so why not the NYer??,1
Still no New Yorker Magazine available to Canadian Kindlers.  Please make it happen?  This is taking too long.  How do the gazillion Canadian consumers make their voices heard?,1
"This would be my ""must buy"". But we can't buy it in the UK, and there appears to be no good reason. Had I known this earlier, I might not have gone for the kindle.",1
It is truly a disappointment that The New Yorker is not made available for international subscribers. I am hoping this policy will be updated soon...,1
It is very sad that The New Yorker is not available for European-based Kindle owners. Please make this available worldwide.,1
I pay 35 a year for the print edition. Why does a version without printing or shipping cost more?,1
"This is it, the magazine of stories that you have enjoyed for years now finally available for your KIndle.

Get it now if you enjoy this magazine.",5

While this book has many good tips and techniques it is for some one who already know their way around an embroidery machine.,4
"I only received 1 magazine when I had a year subscription from 01/04/2013 to 01/04/2014.  Don't buy this magazine, they will take your money but not deliver the product.",1
I wouldn't recommend this magazine to anyone unless you enjoy advertisements. I understand the need to advertise but there is very little content throughout. Avoid.,1
I have a problem with the service. We relieved only two magazines In a year time. Where did the other ones go?,1
"got this for a friend.  its awful.  AND really hard to cancel.  don't get this magazine.  covers look flashy, but mostly adverts and articles are lame.",1
"This is a very informative magazine, but probably more advanced the average player needs or would be able to put into action.",3
Why don't they just call it the NEW WORLD ORDER magazine.  I cant believe anything in this mag.  Makes me sick.,1
Good coverage of hunting in Southern Africa. Gears reviews are objective and concise. The magazine could use more content per issue.,4
I did not request or want to renew.  You just did it on your own.  I should not have to pay for it,1
"Good magazine. Only complaint is that they send ""THIS IS YOUR LAST ISSUE"" from about the 3rd month, on ... annoying and confusing.",4

Trying to collect a full set.  Love this magazine!,5
Some parts of the MAD magazine are still entertaining but has lost a lot of its oomph from previous years.,3

I ordered this for my son. He loves reading MAD Magazine. It is the closest he has ever been to a comic book.,5
Teenage son (and his father) love this magazine. They are always excited when a new issue arrives... they love it so much we renewed for a second year!,5
We have received only 3 issues in the one year since I ordered the subscription. I filed a complaint with the FTC after contacting Mad multiple times and getting no response.,1
My grandson loves mad magazine. He was very excited when he received this as a gift. He read it over and over.,5
So happy reading this again. It brings me back to my childhood. Now I can pass it down to my kids.,5

Perfect compendium of daily liturgy,5
"Great day to day meditation. I strongly recommend it. Besides the daily meditation and gospel, they have great articles. Congratulations",5

The only I don't like is that I can't book mark spots so I can go back and forth easier during mass.",3

I love having this magazine in Spanish. My children are using it to keep up with their Spanish reading skills.,5

I love this magazine since I was a kid! Excellent to have at your finger tips.,5
"Amazing Quality, Great content and good price.
National Geographic is really worth the try. Go ahead give it a go",5
It uis just the best magazine ever. I find it to be the most pieasurd to read. with so many articles to read about.,5
It doesnt seem like Kindle includes all the pictures. The quality of the writing seems to have declined over the years.,3
"I got several books for my Granddaughter, she is six years old and reads Thrid grade books.  She loves to read and you have the best.  She loved the books.  Thank you",5

"Though it does not specifically say what devices will support it, I have not been able to get it to work on my Nook Simple Touch.",1
"Not impressed with this magazine, it wants to be allure, but very thin and nothing to read about.  Boring, boring , and Boring!",1
I've deleted and reloaded twice and still haven't finished the first issue  and I have to reload the magazine each time i reload the app,1
"If I could give it zero stars I would. My ""All Access"" has disappeared and nobody from amazon to the publishers what to do anything about it.",1
"Great magazine. In magazines, print trumps digital",5
Both my husband and I really enjoy this magazine and read it monthly. We ready it cover to cover each month.,5
Wired magazine is one of the very few magazines that I actually read from cover to cover. Every month I find myself indulging in its contents. Highly recommended,5
"Wired is the best magazine ever, it covers all sorts of topics and does so with some balance and fairness.",5
There isn't much more to say. Wired has created a wonderful reading experience. I am sure they will find more ways to amaze. I would highly recommend this publication to anyone.,5

"This magazine is a good read. Most of the, I find something interesting to read about. I recommend to certain tech nerds.",4
I do not have a pad and wanted to read my Wired on line via my Mac.  Can't do it.,1
Have not been able to access anything. It's very complicated to get it to work. Was really looking forward to reading Wired but no such luck.,1
"I paid for a two year subscription, after two Issues they changed to a ""web only"" magazine and stopped sending me issues. So now i paid to subscribe to some blog, Worthless!",1
"Great magazine.  Love the glossy copy in my mailbox and the digital, interactive one on my iPad.  Never disappoints me.",5
"Perhaps this magazine deserves more of a chance, but I had been hoping for more clever content and have not seen it so far.",3
"beautiful mag, great copy. everything I expect of vanity fair. I guess i get an online copy too, but for the price I was happy just to get a few physical magazines",4
I was not allowed to download so i request to cancel the suscription and they didn't do it. I tried all the options they have to download but none of them worked.,1
It encompasses everything I love from fashion to advice on love. I love it from page to page. Awesome read!,5
I love the articles in this magazine.  They're very insightful and ahead of their time.  I've had a subscription now for years,5
I have always loved vf's writing and whimsy. The online mag is well laid out and easy to navigate. Buy!,5
"Good mix of fluff and some news.  Not exactly an academic experience, but relaxing.  What can you say about a fluff magazine?  Don't buy for educational reasons.",3
I do not have the November or December issures. Still showing the October issue. What gives. Not the Vanity Fair I thought it would be.,1
"NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED MY SUBSCRIPTION, TOOK THE MONEY FROM MY CC BUT NO MAGAZINE.
PLS. INVESTIGATE THIS.  WOULD YOU LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM",1
I was not able to open it up on my Kindle. The only articles that came through were the ad pages?,1
"Magazine arrived in a timely manner, however the e-version still has bugs.",4
I prefer the magazine this way it is terrible! You cannot see the pages great and I do not like it!,1
getting this app installed is more trouble than it's worth.  I prefer to stick with the paper version of the magazine,1
"I travel frequently (as do my devices) between US and UK a lot, but iPad appleid is uk based. Cant get the deal to work on my uk apple id (account not recognised)",1
Not really worth it. There are other magazines with more information. Didn't have enough information to bother reading.  I don't really care about what celebrities are wearing.,1
This magazine lack on subjects to catch the avid reader is more just pictures and tag prices! Need more editorial improvement.,2
"I've yet to receive my hard copy, and the digital All Access copy doesn't include iphones so I cannot access it.",1
"This was a waste of money, I can not access my subscription!!!! Very Frustrating and no way to solve problem.",1
Love the format and easy navigation.  Took a while to download on the ipad though.  Always a good read better on the ipad,4
Excellent accessibility. Vanity Fair is a wonderfully written magazine. It is great to be able to take this with me.,5
"Just using the printed issues - the old fashioned way. Followed the intructions clearly and it would not work.  Also, Vogue is just not as good as it used to be 1980-2000.",2
I bought this item from you and I can't view it on my Galaxy Tab and I haven't received any issue in the mail either. It was a waste of money in my opinion.,1
"When I tried to get service from Vogue it
took them two days to say: ""sorry we can help""
DON'T DO IT.  I WASTED 20.00...",1
I have not been able to use it. I have clicked on all the links to access it and my computer can't read it. Very frustrating.,1
I was surprised to see that the subscription include magazines from 2 months ago. It was not such a good surprise...,3
Basically no recipes...,1
I'm Paleo and I love this magazine because it consistently gives me delicious recipes and fitness info. It's just a really all around great and beautiful magazine!,5

Favorite pet magazine that I get.  originally sread it at the dentist office and ordered it ever year since.  Fun and informative.,5
I have orderd this but have not received any issues yet - how do you rate something they have not sent you?  It must be 6+ weeks since ordered,1
IF YOU HAVE MEGA BUCKS AND A DOG(S)? BUY THIS MAGAZINE.....IF YOU ARE MIDDLE CLASS AND LOVE YOUR PETS AS MUCH AS  YOU CAN THEN PASS ON THIS ONE.,2
this has to be the worst magazine ever... total waste. full of ads. nothing else.,1
Not exactly what I was thinking.  Ok for what it is.,3
Not a magazine ...it is one big advertisement.  I had high hopes for this publication.  Stick with Traditional home or one of those.  Big disappointment.,1
"Too any advertisements, not enough recipies.",2
"this is a front for advertizers selling pharmaceuticals.  Wow!!  Not a decent recipe, just ads for pills.",1
When I pay for an HBO subscription I don't get tons of pointless ads so when I pay for a magazine subscription I expect the same.,1
I prefer Taste of Home Magazine.,3
There are a lot of advertisements. Almost every other page was filled with a full page ad or just a product placement.,2
Love Allrecipes!!  Great recipes!  It's the only site I go to for any recipe.....they never fail me!!,5
"Love this magazine, lots of great recipes, tips on all household items, loved it so  much gave as gift to several of my nieces...and they loved it...",5
One of my favorite cooking magazines.,5
Took too long to arrive...full of ads,1
Way too many ads,2
Love this magazine.  So colorful and full of recipes.,5
This magazine is too crazy inside.  It's like a BIG GIANT COMMERCIAL.  I will stick with Taste of Home.,1
"nice magazine, like the recipes",4

On my Kindle can't read the recipes or pages,1
Ok some good recipes,3
Fantastic cooking magazine!  Great recipes and always full of recipes you can actually use!!!  Love it!,5
I like reading all recipes from the website but the print in this online magazine is just too small to be useful. I cancelled my subscription only hours after starting it.,2
Nothing good to say,1
"Love it, and you cannot beat the price.",5
inexpensive ideas with lots of good ideas and recipes,4

Good source for new recipes..,4
This is my favorite cooking magazine...Love it....well worth the cost and much more affordable than most!,5

Awesome magazine! Wished they did 12 mags a year :(,5
I love it!!,5
The last 2 months this magazine would not download.  So I paid for items I couldn't even open up,1
There is nothing new here.  Just reprinting recipes that are already on the website.,2
Love it! Its perfect and helpful for cooking for my little family!,5
I love all recipes and use the web site frequently. The magazine is very well laid out with more great recipes and helpful tips from reviewers.,5
Great recipes with clear directions. Plus there are modifications listed which make each recipe extremely versatile. A must-have for the home cook.,5
Not like it was years ago. Seemed like a mini edition. Didnt find any good recipes I wanted to try.!,3
Disappointed.  This magazine never had adds and now it does....,1
One of my favorite magazines! Great reference.,5
wow love this mag.,5
My sister-in-law loves to cook and absolutely loves this magazine!,5
I usually love the Taste of home magazine. I just didn't love this issue.,3
Delivery is right on time. I love the recipes.,5
"I love cooking magazines. This is a great one. Taste of Home has beautiful pictures, easy to follow recipes. It is a great magazine.",5
Send old issues to count as part of the new subscription.  Not right,1
Several years ago I was also receiving this magazine.  It is 1/4 the size it used to be with not many recipes inside.,2
I used to have a subscription several years ago.  Seems like there isn't as much content to the magazine now.  Not sure if I'd order again.,3
"Love this magazine, down home cooking",5

Favorite food magazine. I've loved it since I was ten.,5
one of the best magazines that there is,5

"Best cooking magazine that exists! I subscribe to many cooking magazines, but Taste of Home far exceeds the others. Holiday issues are especially wonderful",5
"Everything that used to be good has gone to the dogs these days, including Taste of Home magazine! The Liberalites have taken over. Sad!",1
"If you love to cook and try different recipes, this is the magazine for you. They have a variety of recipes too. We have tried many of them and they are great.",5
I bought this magazine for my husband who is a network administrator and he reads cover to cover. I have no tech background and I enjoy looking at some of the articles as well.,4
I never used this feature.  I'd rather have the physical magazine than the digital version.  I like the tangible feel of the magazine.,2
Got it for one year for $5. Now it's kn auto renew for $25 and I can't figure out how to turn it off. May have to call them...,1
Not my kind of reading.,2
"Bad experience. These magazines are almost like 85% adds and 15% real info. I wish I could cancel this. By the way, they enrolled me for another year. Just plain bad.",1
Disappointed with the design of the magazine. I couldn't get into the content.,2
I'm just not a fan of wired magazine.,1
"A pain to load on tablet, and a pain to read on a tablet",3
"This ""magazine"" is at least 50% advertisement.",1
"I love the articles in Wired. They are relevant, interesting, and educational.",5
"Enjoy the magazine, but too complicated to download & read.  Sorry!",1
"A self-absorbed, narcissistic rag!",1
Good Product Great Price - What I was hoping for,4
The one magazine I read from cover to cover.,5
"I love this magazine, always interesting articles, great photos and even the ads are interesting.",5
"While Vanity Fair isn't what it used to be under Tina Brown, it's still worth a subscription. As far as guilty pleasures go, this is a harmless one.",4
"Best mag, digitally and for real.  Dolan's guest editing was fantastic and matched the movie!",5
"solid magazine, glad for the subscription",4
Not impressed with Content,1
I needed Vanity Fair for Kindle with the ability to enlarge text. Could not do that,1
The publication was great as always I purchased in February of this year and was shocked that it auto-renewed in november.  Not happy about this!,1
OMG the ads take up half of the magazine.  I could fall asleep before they get to the good articles.,3
Not happy with the publication,2
Was meant to extend subscription - now getting double issues. Useless.,1
Enjoy reading this magazine.,4
no-hope it is cancelled~it is printed on colored background and difficult to read,1
"I loved Wired, and the price ended up higher than I thought. Just use the mail slips after your first one.",4
"I bought this for my son, he loves it.  Delivered when it said it would be.",5
The articles have gotten very gimmicky with misleading headlines and pandering subject matters. It's a real shame wired sold out.,2
I haven't received all the issues in the mail and I can't access the website on my kindle.  DO NOT buy this.,1
The above  Didn't the above get your attention.  If not Vanity Fair is brain dead.  etc  etc  etc  etc etc,1
I was completely unable to download it to my ipad so it was worthless to me --- I would really like to try it again if it would work.,1
Tried and tried and could not get the all access to work. I tried e-mailing them for help but to no avail.,1
I love getting it on my kindle. I have it everywhere!  Makes it easy to access and share. Thanks again.,5
Love my Bon Appetit!!!,5
some months much better than others but overall ok,3
"Love Bon Appetit, hate hate hate this app. It totally sucks. After a year I still couldn't even navigate from page to page. Ugh, terrible terrible app.",1
"Many repetitive recipes.
Hard to get through the process of authentication once you subscribed it.",3
"I loved La Cucina, but since it's no longer available in this country this magazine is okay.",3
This is my favorite cooking magazine! Great recipes that never disappoint.,5
"great product for the money.  Love the paper version as well as the digital version.  Especially the recipe section, it is very convenient.",5
Love this magazine and digital viewing is amazing with the shop from app option I'm a happy girl! Love allure,5
Allure is one of my favorite magazines!,5
Hi! Love this magazine.,5
Best Magazine I have ever paid for. Always the most interesting stuff in them and samples!,5
The magazine is not delivered in Brazil - and this is not stated in the original information.,1
Don't bother the spam of emails won't stop even after you request to be taken off email list,1
"It's ok, but the magazine has 90% Publicity and VERY short articles to actually READ... :/",3
"I liked that I received it, but on the first night of reading, I nearly finished it!",3
My download wasn't in English. I can't even read it.,1
can't figure out how to view digital version.  what a rip. :(,1
Too many ads but ok,3
"So far, they have only sent me one issue, which came LATE after the month had already passed. (I got the September issue in October. Really?)",1
"Love love my magazine, I get so excited",5
Good deal!!!!!!,5
"When they say there is a version for a tablet, they mean it. Unlike Kindle for PC, it's tablet or nothing. Next time I'll take their word for it.",1
"The content IS advertising! The whole magazine is nothing but promotion of products, and they should pay ME to read it.",1
It's a lifestyle magazine not fashion. I do not need to see two guys making out or a nude woman to learn fashion trends. No content just ads.,1
"Haven't received a bOOk yet, and it seems like the 6 months is actually 4. Not happy about this subscription so far.",1
Unable to sign up for digital access. Hopefully the print copies with arrive but very disappointed with the digital copy,1
Can not access on line. Very disappointed. Only gave 1 star because I had to in order to get to this point to rate!,1
Wish it would say that it was not for kindle fire before I bought it and spent money on it,1
"I liked the articles about exercises you can do at home.
I liked the interviews with the person on the cover.
I would recommend it to someone interested in exercising.",4
I can not get the magazine on my kindle or Samsung tablet.  I am very VERY disappointed.  This is the only amazon purchase I have ever had a problem with. :(,1
Love this magazine! Lots of great exercise and fitness tips. Even from celebreties. I have a hard time putting an issue down when I start flipping through the pages!,5
I have been waiting way too long for the delivery of my first paper copy. and the electronic version is difficult to find/ access on a PC.,1
Wish it was published more then 4 times a year. This is my favorite magazine and always look foward to reading,5
Boring magazine...all advertisments,2
i don't know how to use the one for oneline yet and i like the one that comes in the mail,3
Wonderful platform for up-and-comers; wonderful resource for enthusiasts.,5
"I only got to see the second issue I received, since the first issue disappeared before I could read it.  I didn't like the story I read at all.",1
"The perfect bite-sized goodness.  A work of art, a short story and a poem.  I look forward to this every week.",5
"disappointing - totally obscure, boring, will stick with the NY Times book review on Kindle to discover new authors and interesting essays",1
Sorry to be the first bad review but I never found any of the stories interesting except 2 and I apparently don't like poetry which I've never tried to read until now.,2
"not available for latam. When will that be fixed? it's absurd that in this digital era and selling Kindle devices across the world, content is restricted",1
"I would really love to have this feature for my kindle. Unfortunately, it is not possible to download day one if you are a german customer. Will this be changed any time soon?",1
wish there was more tattoos to get ideas from,3
So little of this magazine is actually dedicated to tattoos.  Some of the models are attractive but only have a few scratchy tattoos.,3
Lovely magazine.  Great ideas and very good recipes.,4
"Love everything about this magazine. Beautiful photos, great design inspiration, lovely recipes.",5
More ads than I expected. Some good recipes,3
One of the most lovely magazines out there!!,5
The content of this magazine is much too frivolous for my lifestyle. Will not be renewing.,2
Love reading and getting new ideas. Always room for improvement that's why I didn't give 5 stars,4
My Mom and I are avid fans! Couldn't go a month without reading this great magazine! WooHoo! From 2 Fans!,5
"Wasn't what I wanted. Wanted the Spring in the South edition. Didn't get a chance to view.
Will have to see if this is worth the money.",1
"I was so excited to see my favorite magazine in digital form until I saw it is not available for iPad. Oh well, hopefully soon.",2
Love this mag!  I can actually understand the direction and the recipes always turn out great! Highly recommend!,5
"It's the basic southern recipes for the holidays-nothing spectacular.  Actually, it's not very memorable.  I had forgotten I had it on my Kindle.",3
Not as good as I hoped it would be. I'm more of a technical person so only one issue so far has kept my interest. The WIRED email articles I get are usually more interesting.,3
The editorial design was so busy and unattractive.,1
"Never got the hat, the auto renew was kicking in for way more than it was worth.",1
"This was a gift for my son,and he loves it",5
Good service from Wired! One of the best magazines left to date,5
Did NOT receive the hat.  I would NOT recommend falling for this 'free' hat offer.,1
"Love this magazine with its updates on subjects covered: IT, 3d printers, hacking, etc",5
Never got my hat,1
Great deal! thanks,5
It's been awhile since I've read Wired but I just didn't like the complete outlook of this recent magazine... good articles though!,3
"My husband, who never goes near our computer, loves this. At one store, the puzzled clerk stared and said ""Weird?"" He beamed and said, ""That too.""",5
Love to read this magazine.,5
Could not get even one magazine yet!!! Could not access the electronic content either.,1
Its awful,1
Thought this was a technology magazine.  My first issue has about 16 pages dedicated to sex.  Just a trial subscription.  Glad I didn't order for a year or more.,1
Was hoping to get tuned into men's fashion but this just has a lot of stuff I'm not personally interested in.,2
Nothing but stupid ads and stinky articles.,1
I have not been able to access it.,1
Magazine is great but we did not receive the free gear bag and have not tried the digital series yet,3
Magazine is great but the emails are a nuisance. Once subscribed it seems there are lots of offers for stuff.,3
Everyone should get a subscription and a hat which I love,5
Got the hat but not a single issue of the magazine.  (4 months later).  Subscribe at your own risk!!!!,1
"Great hat and an even better magazine. Thanks, AGAIN, Amazon.com",5
"GQ hasn't sent any issues to me it's March I bought this is January and, yes I did purchase the print deal.",1
Not what I expected. Thought I was getting paper copy don't like digital copy,1
Product was incomplete,1
"Horible, their app did not work on my older iPad and there was no way to read online on my laptop or desktop. How can a technology magazine be so technically incapable.",1
Only received one issue and then their systems altered my address and have yet to receive more issues or the bag. Fail so far.,1
LOVE Wired!,5
Its September and still have not seen one issue (3 months),1
Great deal and a great magazine,5
"Great stories, great content!",4
what a terrible magazine.,1
"Make sure you receive your gift.  Because once you pay, you're just a number.",1
Was expecting more style tips!,3
ads ads ads. too many ads. too trendy content.,2
"Amazing deal free hat along with an amazing magazine, theres no down side",5
"I have subscribed yesterday using Amazon, but the digital access does not work on my iPad. What a shame to both of them.",1
"PUBLISHES FORGETS TO SEND THEM REGULARLY.
I HOPE THEY ENSURE THAT SUBSCRIBER IS TAKEN CARE OF.

IT IS AN EXCELLENT JOURNAL AND VERY USEFUL",3
Wired is not an easy app to use; the articles are difficult to get into ; app is not intuitive,1
"i never got the password, i never got the cap
what a total waste of my time and my money",1
Magazine is made for the ADHD crowd if that is even possible in a magazine.  I think this one will be cancelled quick.,1
"I was first enticed by the free tote. Then I actually got the magazine and fell in love with it. It has great recipes and a great knowledge of good food.

Subscribe now",5
I tried to download it to my kindle fire and it would not download I wish it would have said that it wasn't for kindle fire,1
I reviewed this magazine low because it contains mostly advertisements. This was disappointing! It would be nice to see more useful articles and recipes.,2
"The color was not white as shown, but an unattractive off white,yellowish shade. It looks more like a gym bag than a weekender bag. I was quite disappointed!",2
Love Vanity Fair! My go-to magazine! The price was great too! Now I can read the magazine in print and digitally and received a cute tote bag as well!,5
"No I was unable to download vanity fair magazine on my Ipad
I am very disappointed",1
Great way to read the magazine & easy to set up.  The free tote was a nice touch too,4
Haven't subscribed to VF in a long time. The issue with Robert Downey Jr  made me try it again.,3
Vanity Fair is a great magazine. The articles are well written and thought provoking,2
Not too happy with Vanity Fair. Articles are just taken off the web. Will not renew.,2
"I like to read a magazine, and never have time to wait and read the digital version.",4
Best magazine on the market,5
Love this magazine. Amazon's ability to manage all your magazine subscriptions from their site is a welcome tool.,5
Was a great way to go but lately online issue not downloading right. Take for ever or have to go to manage page and resend. What happened? People also has problem,1
I was super excited for this.  The first magazine I got was a couple months old and I am still waiting for the scarf.  I hope they get on track!,1
"The magazine is 75% advertisement, but I love their articles.  However, the bag definitely is not worth it.  Get the magazine if you like it, but you'll throw the bag away.",2
Magazine great from beginning to end. But the handbags handle torn at connection site of bag and unusable so a definite disappointment.,3
I was supremely disappointed with the bag and subscription. I wanted more depth to the subscription and higher quality from the bag.,2
I got the magazine when I thought it would never get here. I got the free scarf but never got the other two booklets. Not really that impressed.,1
This magazine is mostly adds and ugly fashion choices that the average woman cannot afford anyway.,1
I did not receive my free gift!,1
Love the magazine but never received the infinity scarf!,3
Canceled magazine... nothing in it!,1
never received digitals guides,1
The magazine is full of ads.  Not enough substance.  The Free weekender bag looks like it was sewed by a home economics student.  Very cheap!,2
"The bag makes a cute weekender for my 8 year old son! But hey, it was free, so I can't complain! :)",3
Somewhat good. Is nothing important on this magazine at all.,3
No comment that's positive. Not what was advertised,1
i can't use all access. no tablelet.,1
STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN MY FREE GIFT AND WILL BE CANCELING MY SUSCRIPTION,1
Continually promotes promiscuity in their articles.,1
Not impressed at all; tote set was thin and very cheaply made,1
Magazine arrived great. However the red bag zippered pocket ripped after first use and the internet download never could connect or download.,2
"The tote is hideous. Magazine's okay. Some articles are really useful while the fashion is hideous, just like the tote.",3
Looked nicer in the picture,1
Nice  but small than expected.,3
Love this magazine! The electronic edition is very user friendly. No issues reading it on my iPad or Nook. Highly recommend to anyone.,5
Kim Kardashian on Glamour now there's an oxymoron!,1
What happened to the days of once a month magazines? These are coming once a week!,3
"Got a great buy, and love being able to read Glamour on my tablet!",5
Will not be re-ordering this magazine.,2
We did not receive the tote,1
"Love the magazine. I haven't gotten the tote yet, it's been 2 months.",3
I did not receive the free tote.,1
"Magazine is great, but no tote as stated",3
great price and great promotion and very impressed with amazon.,5
The may issue is where but I have still not been able to read the April issue! I am very frustrated,1
"Never get the bag, as magazine not to bad",1
Moved in June and tried to cancel my subscription but it is still showing as processing,1
Absolutely love this magazine!,5
Cheap. Threw it away immediately.,1
Loved my free wristlet and truly enjoy my Vogue all Access.  Love reading the issue on my ipad and love my big physical copy the articles and advertisements!,5
Meaningless!!! just page after page ad...content is nothing to be excited about...Don't buy,1
Renewed through AMAZON. The clutch is great!!! Can't live without Vogue. Have been receiving it for five years.,5
"The magazine isn't what it used to be. I'm not really reading it but still, I'm disappointed that the big September issue hasn't come.",3
"Jesus tap dancing Christ, get your hot mess together Vogue.",1
Would be great except I didn't receive my Sept issue or any free clutch.,1
I never received the free clutch. The magazine is  mostly ads; had to search for articles. The digital edition takes up too much data and doesn't maneuver easily.,1
"Vogue is my Bible. I learned to shoot fashion from Vogue and its great photographers. Vogue is a classy magazine, well edited, and with terrific art direction.",5
"Nice magazine, I didn't get my free clutch with it but Owell",3
90 % ads. Very little content. Didn't receive the clutch.,2
Have received 2 issues of the magazine now which I love. Never received the clutch:(,3
"Its not the best magazine, but it is not the worst.",3
Girl friend loves this mag,5
I'm yet to receive a magazine or a free clutch. Terrible.,1
"Not worth the price,  even if Amazon offer to you FREE.  Nothing in it,  only poker faced modells.  Im not enjoy it at all.",1
It did not come with a clutch as stated.,1
Never got the clutch.,1
"I have been a fan of Vogue for decades.  The ""Free Clutch"" is a joke.",1
"got 2 old magazines, however no clutch",1
The magazine is great. But the clutch was landfill. More like something you'd receive at a nail polish promotion.,3
Clutch did not arrive. Vogue is wonderful!,1
"love my first ""mag""....never subscribed to Vogue b/4...love it, glad I did...",5
"Doesnt really work, I guess I didn't read the fine print about what type of op system it works with, but I love vogue so I just ignore the kinks and keep it moving!",3
"No matter what price you pay, be sure it is too high. 95% of the volume are advertisements. For the amount of junk you get, you should be paid to just go through it.",1
Glad the free clutch is not the reason I subscribed to Vogue.,1
No digital access from an android. Come on Vogue.,1
Have not been able to get it to work.  Had to pay for it.,1
I couldn't download my subscription. And customer service couldn't really do anything to help me. I received my hard copy subscription but was unable to download my digital copy,1
informational,4
Love it always have always will print or digital!,5
I like paula.but this is awlful. and way to many avertiments don't waste your money!!!!!!,1
Paula Deen is awesome. Lover her recipes. Food network was crazy to let her go and I hope her new network does great.,5
"Love! Love! Love it! Welcome Back Paula. Wishing you all the best! The world is a better place with you.....your talent,  generosity and honesty.",5
Way overpriced,2
WILL I AM SURE I WILL ENJOY READING WATCH IF IT EVER GETS HERE WHATS THE DEAL ANY WAY I KNEW IT WAS NOT SHIPPED RIGHT AWAY BUT HEY IT HAS BEEN LONG ENOUGH SINCE I ORDERED IT,1
Sure fire way to bring freeloading bed bugs into your life is buying used furniture from ANYWHERE. I'm even talking about junk to Antiques. No no and hell NO,1
The best business mag out there,5
"Great magazine, the best.",5
"It's a good magazine, with a blend of different stories.  Doesn't come across as preachy as Forbes.  A decent amount of tech industry content too.",4
$47.99 for a four-issue subscription?!  Is it printed with gold ink?!  No way will I pay over ten dollars an issue for any magazine.,1
"I love this magazine! And to receive a gift as well, was perfect. The make up back is big and roomy.",5
"our two year old grandson just loves this magazine and sits for a very long time paging through it, mind you he never sits still for anything!!!!!",5
Meh.  Sub-par vegan magazine.  Expected so much more. Huge disappointment.,1
Makes our food life very interesting and wonderful!,5
does not work on windows or windows tablet.  WTH?,1
The magazine has gone downhill in the last few years.,3
I ordered a subscription for my dad.  My dad told me that it was just a magazine full of ads and sports articles.  Apparently popular mechanics means ads and sports.,1
"Sick adverts Pop Mechanics. Literally almost every other page has an ad on it, mostly about cars or tobacco related paraphernalia. 1/10, would not read again",1
I got this subscription for my husband. It's his favorite!,5
Great rag.  I love how they have a project in the back that any guy can do with a few basic tools.  I also like to see new products before they hit the shelves.,5
"would NOT display on my windows 7 laptop, so it is of no value at all.",1
U cannot enlarge words in digital version  print is way to small to read in magazine  version I wasted my money,1
Subscription not received,1
It was a gift. She got the tote but here we are months later and still not one issue.,1
Never got the free tote bag,1
I didn't receive my free tote bag. Love my magazine though!,3
I could not download this issue! Help!,1
Great mag. but not suitable to read on tablet.,4
"I really like the magazine, but renewals are stupid expensive.",3
"A little disappointed I can not access the e-version on my pc, only on my smartphone. But, as you would suspect, the content from Food Network is always excellent!",4
My favorite magazine...so many good recipes and beautiful pictures.,5
So happy to have this subscription!,5
"I never received any of the items. i originally placed this same order back in march 2016. i never got that order or this one. not the digital copy, print copy or tote bags",1
Best cooking magazine,5
way to many ads - not enough recipes,2
Great magazine and digital version is awesome!,5
Bought for the wife.  She loves the Food Network and I love the different ideas for meals that she comes up with!!,5
"love the digital, can take it anywhere",5
"The content is GREAT, but having a great deal of difficulty getting online access since I don't own a Kindle.",3
Received Magazine - but no tote,1
"I, like many others, received the tote but no magazine.",1
Love this magazine and this made it so easy to renew.,5
I only received the tote.,1
"Well I never received the magazine, but I got the tote bag",1
Didn't get the free tote they were advertising. Only reason for the 1 star.  The magazine is great,1
"I'm sorry I just like the feel of paper better, i tried, It's just not for me.",1
Magazine is great did not receive the tote bag,3
"Terrific Magazine with LOTS of wonderful recipes.  The price was extremely reasonable, as well!!",5
Thought I would receive paper magazines but I suppose it's only digital.,1
"Subscription is great. I never received the free tote.  Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for!",3
"Got the magazine, but NO Tote.",1
"The magazine is great, however I never received the tote bag.",3
Love food network magazine,5
"I love Food Network magazine. I was very disappointed in the tote bag. The fabric is flimsy wend the bag looks cheap. Seriously, Food Network you could do better than this.",2
Never got free tote. No note was given that it was a gift. Tried to order another gift with the $5 special but it wouldn't go through,1
I have always loved Good Housekeeping and am happy with the magazine. But I never received the tote bag which is disappointing.,3
Always a winner,4
"The magazine is fine. Lots of great recipe and decor ideas. However, I have not rec'd my free tote bag :-(",3
I paid for both and they cancelled digital after a month and a half.  Do not buy!,1
the cover was torn,1
Already cancelled it...,1
I would give it more stars if the online version worked on the Kindle.  Apparently there is some problem with the kindle version.,3
I haven't received the magazine,1
"Do not want, did not order, Please cancel per our phone call. Bad bad bad.",1
"Nor as spectacular as the classic issues, but still the best source for these kinds of brain exercises",4
"I love my word puzzles (crosswords, cryptograms, word searches, etc.).  I look forward to every issue.",5
Never received the clutch to go with the magazine which was a gift. Price was right though. Quick read and then it goes to a woman's center,1
More fashion focused. Not very into fitness. More like look like your into fitness while shopping for groceries.,2
Magazine has come on time every month and I received the gift a short time after ordering my subscription.,4
"Bag and physical copy came separately, in that order, within 3 weeks of order!

Love this magazine! Makes me a little more motivated to workout!",5
Not super impressed with magazine. Mainly purchased for gym bag and never got it.,1
It was a great deal!,5
"Wired is an awesome magazine that looks into everything currently going on in our culture, and provides insights into the amazing things you may be missing.  Well worth the money.",5
Most of the recipes are not meals I would make but enjoy the magazine.,3
"I thought I paid for a magazine, not a stupid app! I want the magazine. I don't read magazines on my phone, laptop etc.!!!!!",1
I don't have the capability of seeing the magazine.  I'm waiting on the magazine,1
No cannot download the magazine. It says I have to pay for the subscription,1
Too many advertisements they have really cut back on this magazine,3
Enjoyed my HGTV magazine!,4
Great magazine with great pictures and ideas!,4
Just love Dr. OZ,5
I love the articles and the recipes!!,5
Seems to be more based on products/services for women.,3
I enjoyed every page.,5
"Enjoy reading the magazine, but have trouble bringing up  on line.",4
Didn't happen.  I gave up after hours on the phone.,1
"Awesome magazine, with so much of health and nutrition info!! Love it.",5
ordered both the magazine and the digital.  cannot seem to get the digital on IPAD.,1
Love dr.oz he is the greatest.,5
The digital immediate access is not available and you will be unable to cancel.,1
This is the best and most practical magazine I have ever bought in my 62-years of living.  Thank-you Dr. Oz.,5
The are all great,5
I cancelled.  I could not get o my Ipad.,1
"Expected more articles on foods, recipes and nutrition.",3
"More ad's than I like and not enough recipes, not really impressed but only have received one issue so will see when I have read more.",3
"I have only received one issue so far.  First impression:  Too many ads, not enough useful information.",1
Not as informative as I expected,2
"I am a guy, 80% of the stuff is for women.",3
"Twin Daughters love this guy. Informative, entertaining. OK Dr Oz.",5
This magazine has such great tips and interesting articles.  I look forward to getting every issue.,5
The price was right and it was my first magazine for my tablet. Still learning,4
I love the access on my iPad! I've subscribed to Good Housekeeping for many years. I love this way of reading it.,5
"I didn't like this because I was wanting the subscription for my kindle paper white, or at least for it to accessible web-based and it was not.",2
Gave this to my hubby for Xmas and he loves it.  Great magazine.,5
Gift. Liked it.,4
Great Magazine at a fantastic price.,5
This magazine is geared toward women.,2
Good tips on health and diet. More credible because he is a MD,4
I did not know I had to have an iphone to use the digital version. I do not have an iphone! I requested to cancel my order and now it says I can't! Highly disappointed!,1
Not my thing.  Sorry,1
I ordered the digital Kindle edition and never received it.,1
I love Dr. Oz this magazine is great!,5
Enjoy reading informative articles.,4
Love it! Especially on my kindle!,5
"I marked it one star as I had to mark it at something.  I am having issues with my iPAD and unable to get the subscription app, so I canceled the subscription.",1
Love this deal! Got this as a christmas gift for my in- laws. They loved it!,5
I love the Food Network but the magazine is not nearly as entertaining as my favorite shows.,3
Great Magazine according to my wife...well worth the price.,5
Love this magazine! I love the price I got even more during Christmas!,5
Ordered it digitally 24 hours ago and it's still not available.,1
"I liked the magazine on my Kindle, it worked out well.",4
"has a lot more ads than I expected. info is limited to a few recipes
no real stories, was ok but not the info I expected it would have",3
Recipes with unpronouncable titles and ingredients. It would cost a small fortune to buy all the ingredients and a master chef to cook.,1
Can't locate the magazine on my kindle! Very unfortunate. Also can't get help from Amazon as they hide their telephone number better than a virgin hides her panties!,1
I thought I was getting the magazine by mail.  I cannot read  it on a kindle.  I'm sorry I ordered it.,1
"I love Food Magazine and read it cover to cover soon after it arrives, but there are too many advertisements.",3
Love it! Lots of ideas,5
By far the best magazine of its kind.  Always thrilled when I see it in my mail box.,5
LOVE IT!!!!!,5
"Present for my mother-in-law, she loves it!",5
This is my very favorite magazine - it helps me to dream and reimagine my home!  I share it with my daughters after I am done with it.,5
dissapointed,2
WHO DOESNT LOVE DR OZ,5
"this subscription was automatically renewed at a higher price, which led me to inspect other subscriptions doing the same...guess i should be thankful??",1
Informative and full of great recipes.,4
Good Information,4
Lots of heavy reading.,3
I bought the magazine as a gift and the person I gave it to (a millenial!) never signed up for the online access.,1
Ordered for a friend and she loves it!,5
"My favorite cooking magazine, always great recipes and well organized table of contents. If you are looking for one cooking magazine to get, this is the one!",5
I would like more articles on the Food Network programs and personnel and fewer recipes.  I can get all the recipes I want on Epicurious.com or other sites.,3
Love the mag and the deal they offered.,5
IT was ok. Nice to have recipes on my kindle but also nice to have the magazine.,3
not able to access the magazine on any of my devices.,1
So glad to have it back!,5
Great deal for a low price!,5
"Very unhappy, Unable to get my digital copy on Kindle app without being charged again.",1
Can only use on ipad once. Horrible horrible horrible rip off.,1
Great magazine! It is full of great recipes and tips!,5
Could not download to my Kindle.  What a waste!,1
One of my favorite issues to date,5

Love the OPRAH magazine!,5
Got this for my grandson - he loves it.,5
I can't get it to work.,1

"The worst magazine ever,don't want it anymore.",1
Ive never received this on my Kindle although I was charged the $3.00 for the one issue.  thanks,1
Excellent..,5
Best gun magazine for years,5
"My 11-year-old daughter LOVES this magazine and waits for it every month with abated breath. I love that it encourages good body image and is good, clean entertainment for her.",5
"My granddaughter is thrilled, this is her favorite magazine!",5
This was a gift for my son. He received his first issue yesterday ( his birthday is Saturday).  He says he likes the issue and is pleased that he will receive more issues.,4
Not exactly what I thought it would be. I was expecting the actual magazine.,3
"Good magazine, has a lot of good ideas and articles",4
It's not good. It's not creative. It's boring. Can I return this?,1
Never was able to access,1
"Love this magazine, such a great price and so much information perfect for new moms like myself.",5
I love having both the print and electronic version!,5
I love this magazine. Many great ideas for eating healthy yet delicious meals,5
"Practical, but nice recipes.  Good production value.",4
"Horrible, rude customer service.  I was never able to access digital version on my iPad.  And their customer service was no help.",1
"Pretty good, the recipes have been good so far, just seems kind of skinny",4
"Love this magazine! Great recipes. Have been using the website for years, so was glad to find it in print.",5
"If you are someone who actually cooks, you'll enjoy this.",4
"Always get at least a couple of must-try realistic recipes per issue, and lots of great information on healthier habits. Couldn't beat the deal on this one!",4
Recipes are too complicated and not much of interest otherwise.,2
I love to cook and this is a magazine where I keep recipes and share them with family.,5
"Love this!!! Great, easy to follow recipes and tips.",5
I order the 1 year for five dollars and sadly I have only received two magazines. Very unhappy.,1
Enjoyable reading!,4
Great magazine.  Love it!,5
"Very informative magazine, nice recipes. Visually appealing.",4
"It had very few vegetarian dishes. Seemed to me focused on dairy and meat, they sound like they're being paid to support the industry.",3
LOVE this magazine! I've tried all kinds of the recipes and love the ingredients listed within them.,5
Great gift to give others. A subscription makes a perfect holiday present. Would purchase again,4
Nice over-all coverage and helpful hints make it well worth the time and money.,4
love gathering new ideas to cook and this is my best friend in the kitchen,5
Lousy recipes waste of $,1
"wish there were more recipes, but pretty good so far.",4
Could not access kept redirecting me to an invalid site. Hate it.,1
Love this magazine! All kinds of fun projects to do with kids and grandkids. Each issue is geared to projects appropriate to the season.,5
Came in super fast and just fun to read!!!,5
"I purchased this in error, meant to purchase Womans Day (have no idea how I got those titles mixed up). Dang thing is 90% advertisements and 10% content....really?!",1
I've always enjoyed reading Family Circle and couldn't pass up the opportunity to subscribe at a great rate through Amazon,4
Nothing but advertisements.,1
LOVE it. Beautiful design!,5
I LOVE this magazine!,5
Really interesting topics,4
Wired has become a mouth of the SJW's while somehow managing to increase the irrelevant advertising. The only articles I find interesting have been published online.,2
Only 4 stars because I hated the last issue.  I like Wired Mag.,4
I like this magazine. The articles are relevant and its a nice easy read.,4
"Yeah!! Got a discounted subscription! Only problem is, I've received 4 issues. 2 in the first 40 days. Two months, nothing. Then 2 copies of the same month",1
Enjoy reading this but it is skewed towards men.,4
I love wired magazine and the price for a 6 month subscription can't be beat!! Highly reccomend,5
"Not compatible with apple and windows products is a serious negative factor in 2016......very disappointed....

They make apps/software for the UK but not the US??? wow......",1
If a 5 month subscription is $114 then each magazine would be $22. I think savings listed is false advertising.,1
"I was shocked by the amount of propaganda and sophistry in this once libertarian-leaning publication.  If you are looking for free-thought and reason, look elsewhere.",1
If your thinking of subscribing swing by a news stand and check it out first. I won't be re-subscribing.,1
bunch of garbage,1
Do not renew my subscription.,3
Too difficult to read on the Kindle.,2
Terrible deal. Cannot access on my Kindle. Truly false advertising. And absolutely ZERO customer support. Glad it only cost me $5.00!!!,1
Ok not great,3
"it's just OK, too cutting edge for my tastes",3
Much prefer large print copy of this magazine.,2
"Very well put together, excellent design resource",5
Please do NOT renew my subscription.,3
"too many adds, not enough articles, most of the recipes required ingredients that were difficult to get",3
"I have received the physical version of Bon Appetit, which I love. I have not received the digital version.",1
This is a terrific magazine!  Being able to access electronically is wonderful.  Then getting the magazine in the mail is such a treat.  Can't wait to start cooking!,5
Visually stunning and inspiring. Love to flip through and get ideas for presentation.,5
Love it. I can view it anytime wherever I am at. I don't have to carry the magazine with me.,5
"Deceptive advertising: paid for 5 months at the very end of September, received the notice that billing will start in December.",1
I am DISAPPOINTED......I have tried numerous times to access this and cannot receive it other than the hardcopy!! Not happy!!!!,1
"Love this mag, just received issues !",5
Very happy with my magazine,5
"I purchased this as a gift, the recipient loves the magazine, I thought it was over priced to be honest. I would never purchase this for myself.",3
Lots of ads for paint and more paint.,3
Love this Magazine!!,5
Love it. Looking forward to my next issue.,5
This is my favorite magazine by far. It seems to have less ads in it than other mags. It has interesting ideas. I always look forward to finding this in the mailbox.,5
Love this magazine! So many Affordable good ideas!,5
Awesome magazine.  I can't wait for each issue.,5
Not what I was expecting.,2
Okay but does have damage on cover when I get them in mail,3
The best hunting & fishing coverage available....with great photographs and stories.,5
"Yes, I have always loved outdoor magazines like Field and Stream, love both the magazine and that it's available thru Amazon",5
over priced trash,1
Can't get digital copy,1
Can't get digital subscription.  Would not reorder.,1
My boyfriend loves this magazine and I got it for a great deal!,5
Very disappointing in where this magazine has ended up. Seems to be about a quarter of the pages since I last had my subscription(which was about 5 years ago),2
Can bring it up on my tablet I have no response since I sent a text to get help,1
"Love the magazine already, and at this deal ($5) for the print and digital versions, what's there not to like ?!",5
Needs more articles and less ads.,3
Fair subscription price.,4
Only recieved 2 issuses of this magazine and im only 4 months in,1
Popular science is 100% not worth the money anymore.,1
"I get that mags need ads to survive, but this is crazy. More than half of every issue is ads, digital or print. I won't be renewing.",2
"Still a favorite - since I was a boy.  Now sharing with my son.  A bit too much credence on the global warming scam, but overall still good.",4
"If you like science, this is the magazine for you. Great gift. Excellent articles.",5
Bago products came as thy described. Well stitched well made.,4
I was about to order the subscription to this magazine. I used to get it years ago.....used to be a great magazine but reading the reviews I am hesitant to purchase this.,1
Nothing to see here.  Try something else.,1
This should be free before any one buys it.,1
"been going downhill for 20+ years, now just a waste of trees",1
"This is an Awesome magazine that honors God and Christian living. Give it a try and you want be disappointed. I plan to be a subscriber for many years to come.
Blessings
Wendy",5
It was not as big of a magazine as I though it should be,3
Love it! One of the best magazines I've read!,5
Just could not get into this magazine.,1
awesome devotional. I already had the devotional before I placed this order. I think it's amazing,5
Great magazine. It tell you a lot about survival and other thing that everyone should no about emergencies.,4
I thought I was getting a printed copy of the magazine.....,1
Best price.,5
Bicycling:  you charge $5 for print access or $5 for digital access.  Why would ANYONE pay $20 for print and digital access?,1
For a magazine about active healthy life it's full of ads for bad foods. I cancelled the subscription.,1
It does not download. I haven't even got to read it yet. I asked for help and the link I was given doesn't work. Not happy. You guys have never let me down until now.,1
Not as impressed as I thought I would be with the magazine. Also never received the 15 free guide.,2
I received two magazines and have loved it! It's nice having it delivered to your home and motivates you to keep your butt in shape!,5
Don't order this unless you want to get a LOT of spam!!!!,1
"Interesting articles, however, as with most Weider publications, it is very advertisement heavy...",3
Instructions on how to access the electronic version must be provided. An access link would be best.,1
"Content is good. I like having the actual magazine, but it is very convenient to have the digital access.",4
Not for older men !!,1
"This is a perfect buy, you won't regret it.",5
"Call me old school but, I would prefer to save 10 minutes of my life and wait for the printed edition, whenever that is supposed to start...?",3
"good articles and clear instructions.  Tends to not have the ""here's what I've done and I recommend it"" type articles as much as the ""muscle"" type mags.",4
the app doesnt work 0 stars,1
Really wish this was available on Kindle for PC so I could read it with my Surface Tablet.,1
The magazine frequently has useful information.  Good for the price.,4
I didn't order it. It was spam.,1
Auto-renewal with zero communication it was going to take place. A reminder or two would have been optimal.,1
I find the magazine has many interesting and informative articles that even a 68 year old guy can find educational.,4
Some nice choices for recipes but not things we store in our pantry or fridge on a regular basis.,3
I prefer the email newsletter I receive online,3
"What can I say, it is my favorite magazine and renewing through Amazon is so much easier!",5
I love this book!  All recipes has the easiest to understand and fantastic pictures!,5
This publication had no content I was interested in.  Mostly ads only.  Received a sub s corruption I did not order.,1
Not as interesting of a magazine as I would have hoped. It takes me about 30 min to look through it an be done.,3
Too many ads and very little content. Piece of crap. I'd rather install adblock and browse their website.,1
my hubby loves this magazine. has lots of interesting articles to read.,5
"Too many ads, I guess that's why its free.",3
Cant go wrong with this.  If you watch food network get this.,5
What a deal!  Love my Oprah!,5
"Very dissatisfied with the copy that I got. Torn, crumpled pages and looks like it has gotten wet. Couldn't even scan the pages properly.",1
"Pro's: lots of eye-candy, some good articles, samples of cologne to smell.
Con's: basically a collection of ads (which I suppose some people would like)",3
This is one of my favorite magazines. It's great to take with while waiting for an appointment. There are always so many interesting articles and pictures.,5
Very nice a lot of ideas,4
This is quite the intense magazine. Lots of step by step projects that seem helpful. It just doesn't seem as relevant today with all of the available free DIY resources out there.,3
Great ideas! Suggestions and directions for real life!!,4
Great magazine-thanks!,4
Readers Digest is one of my favorite magazines.,5
Been reading this publication since i could read and thats been 55 years,5

Each month interesting articles to read and use in daily life style. Highly recommend reading.,4
"I love wired, and i love print magazines, i'm sorry i just do. Great buy!",5
Wish there were more every day recipes and less articles.,4
If you love food networks you will love this magazine. Illustrated recipes and good articles. Very colorful.,5
Good information that allows me to choose wisely.,4
NOT any deal. It's NOT one year CR and does NOT include the Annual Buying Guide.,1
Have enjoyed reading this magazine for several years.,4
MY FAVORITE MAGAZINE!,5
"Country Living has been my favorite magazine for years.  I love that flipping through the pages inspires me to create, decorate, and clean my home!",5

"As expected, a must have shelter magazine",5
Got SOAKED with add-on billings. A scam,1
Love everything about this mag.,5
"I have long coveted this magazine.  If you enjoy design and architecture, this is an excellent magazine.",5

I just love my monthly subscription -- they are always on time! :),5
my favorite magazine.,5
Great Magazine...Great Cost!,5
"I didn't get all my print issues - the electronic issue is difficult to read on my tablet and the print sometimes came, sometimes didn't.  Very very disappointing.",2

It provides good details for a beginner in gardening like me.,4
Love this magazine.  Lots of beautiful pictures,5
This is a beautiful magazine. I love the fact that there is a wealth of information regarding gardening without all the ads,5
GREAT GARDENS INFORMATION. THIS PUBLICATION IS FOR BEGINNER AND ADVANCED GARDENERS! FABULOUS INFORMATION AND TIPS. I LOVE & RECOMMEND THIS MAGAZINE!,5
"This is a relaxing journal to read -- not complex, easy to enjoy, but not a fantastically helpful horticultural experience.",4
Lots of advertisement,3
"Too many advertisements!
As always, some usable recipes!",3
Too much advertising and just too much stuff.,2
The kids saw the cover of the magazine and became worried that I was going to make the dish for dinner. The magazine is for the more elite chief not for the average family,3
I absolutely love this magazine!,5
Content is not so exciting,2
"Best magazine on the planet, $5 for 6 months",5
Disappointed. It has changed since I was getting it in the past. Won't renew.,2
I always looked to this magazine when I got it in the past to find really special recipes.  Now is pretty boring.,3
What happened to the words?  Seems like the magazine if full of ads and photos...but scant few words.,3
"I don't know why I like reading this , mostly for entertainment.  Somtimes there is some useful information that I didn't know but it can get redundant.",3
Not for us.  We cancelled subscription.,1
"Love this magazine! Great price, order arrived before specified!!!",5

My husband loves this magazine.  He reads it from cover to cover.,5

A all time favorite mag,5
"This magazine is always a ""work of art""....great photography and  superb and interesting articles which are highly educational! LOVE IT!
Helen Kuzmier",5
Nice to look at but was way too high-brow for me. Did not renew my subscription. Good for the collector of very fine antiques.,3
"The Digest's cartoon in the December issue would be inappropriate in any magazine but in a Catholic magazine it borders on disgusting and blasphemous!!!

L. Giarratano",1
It's good but doesn't stand out among the competitors such as Esquire and GQ.,3
Horrible magazine. Worthless piece of crap. All ads. A shame they cut trees Down for this garbage.  Ad delivery system.,1
"Cheaply made, grey paper, tears apart on the first read through, and not much information either. I will not be ordering this again. There are much better cat magazines out there",2
Great book & service!,5
HORRIBLE. Waste of money. All ads. Piece of cheap. Don't bother.,1

One of the best magazines ever.,5
faux-woke neoliberal garbage,1
"I abhor any magazine making fun of peop! es looks, etc.",1
"A lot of technical information for hunting, but also some information related to species and environment",3
Always timely info. Will use internet edition next.,4
Eh... kind of interesting.  The LP is going in the toilet a bit so I'm losing interest.  Probably unfair to penalize Reason for that though.,3
Don't waste your time. Depressingly bereft of reason.,1
"good overall magazine ,it has mostly sport bike articles",4
I find this magazine very biased.  Would not recommend it.,1
"If you're an avid snowmobiler, SnowGoer is one of the best!  Especially like the issue about snowmobiling destinations.
Thanks SnowGoer!",5
Overpriced magazine with little to no value.,1
Horrible.,1
Just like current history I cannot navigate this publication on my Amazon fire tablet,1
"I never received a single issue of this subscription. I'm sure the magazine is great, but the order fulfillment was a failure. Money wasted.",1
Received a few issues so far. Unimpressed. Written at grade 7 level at best.,3
Only received one copy and the mailing ceased.,1
My stepdad loves to fly and he was very excited to get this magazine.  He flies his own personal plane and this was perfect for him.,5
Great for any pilot!!!,5
don't recvid,1
"The price was great and could not be beat. I think I paid $5 bucks?!

Great price and it came a month sooner than I was told.,5
"Ok, not the best Guitar Mag.",3
I sent this magazine to my brother in prizon.  He likes this mag,4

"Have only gotten 1 issue so far.  Will have to update this post later.  However, $5 for a year subscription is a great price!",4
My daughter love's it,5
This rag sucks!,1
Really not good.,1
"One giant ""Work at Home"" advertisement.  My first issue lauded the glories of using ""Click-Bait"" advertising.",1
all commercials/adds....,2
Never received any issues,1
Terrible magazine. Not worth the money nor time.,1
Fantastic recipes in every issue + tips and tricks to make cooking and baking FUN!,5
"Love the magazine, just wish it were thicker!",4
"My very favorite magazine subscription to date.  If you enjoy travel, this is the magazine for you!",5
Love this magazine. Magazine seems to always have great write-ups. Well worth the price.,5

"Interesting information, formatted easy to read",4
The magazine is mostly advertisements.,2
"Took awhile to start up, but I love it",4
NOT ENOJUG READING MATERIAL IM INTERESTED IN,1
This magazine has gone down hill quickly. The writing is terrible and the journalistic quality is nonexistent.,1
Horrible democratic propaganda. Nothing is worth reading in this overpriced pile of crap.,1
just trash,1
"Disgraceful cover and hate photos & words, especially against office of presidency & conservative individuals & citizens.",1
Disgusting magazine,1
The first words in the lines of the articles were cut off. Frustrating.,2
"For the almost six months I have had this subscription, I have received only three (3) magazines.",1
"Love this magazine, and the ease of getting it for a great price",5
this magazine will mostly give you complex advertizing disguised as reviews and reports. very little practical use.,1
The quality of the writing is very poor. They have low life authors like Jesse Ball writing articles for this magazine.,1
How can I review this when I haven't got it yet? I will never buy a magazine subscription from Amazon again. Almost 2 months and I haven't received anything yet!,1
Only recieved 1 issue :-(,1
Excellent.  Just what I expected.,5
This magazine is mostly east coast. Very little west coast coverage. Boat and equipment usually on very high end $.  Doesn't fit my needs or interest. I prefer more practical info,2
To many adds not enough information,2
love the magazine wish it had more street stock stuff though,4
I ordered this a long time ago and I  never received one issue of this magazine,1
Havent even got a magazine yet and i order in july,1
"Will not work with the kindle app, ONLY an actual kindle device. Doesn't seem fair.",1

"Being a vet during the Vietnam war, but not being stationed in Vietnam, I find the articles interesting.  It fills me in on what other vets stationed in Vietnam were experiencing.",4
keeps him busy,4
Fast Shipping Great,5
I have never received this product...I wonder what happened...I hope I am not paying for it...I have to check my records...,1

Love sunset magazine & price,5
This magazine is very diverse in content it is a great change from dupont registry,4

Cant seem to unsubscribe but it keeps being deducted from my account!!!,1
"Not a bad read, just a little short on content.",3
Lots of ads.,3
Forgot I picked this up as a Today's Deal and will  not renew. Too much advertising and not enough food related stuff.,3

This Mag is the best out there in my opinion for extreme metal lovers. The deal I recieved for suscribing was awesome! money well spent.,5

"This magazine is widely available for $20 per year on other sites.
The $39.00 price offered here is not a good deal",1

Very high quality and will keep you informed on the trends in the industry. Highly recommended if you are a web designer or dev.,4
My 13 year old son LOVES the magazine!!,5
The stories/reports are not especially deep. I was also looking for more historical artlcles. Much thinner than I rememember.,3
Love the Magazine. Lots of hunting and fresh water fishing discussion. Even tells me what time of the day to hunt/fish.,5
If you are into fishing and live in the lower half of the state this magazine is not going to be one you subscribe to more than once.,1
I love hotrods and love to see all the different vehicles people build. The photography in this magazine is amazing!,5
Seems to be an advertisement catalogue more than a hotrod magazine lately.  still a few decent articles,3

"Nice mag, have enjoyed reading it again.  Probably better suited to younger people but I found enough to make it worthwhile.",4
Sensationist journalism without a lot of fact checking. it's not left wing at all nor it is right wing. It's just full of bogus info.,2
too paritisan. I don't need someone to persuade me. I can make up my own mind. I want both sides of an issue. I will give it another couple of weeks.,1
"Got these to put in the kids area of our waiting room, very popular read for the kids!",4

Don't order this....",1
A magazine without backbone - disappointed. Will never purchase or subscribe again.,1
I use this mag for design ideas for my home.  It's perfect for my needs.,5

Way too many ads but I like keeping up with decor ideas and trends.,4
"I have subscribed to Country Woman for many years.  Love, love, love it!  Nothing negative to say.",5
Too many ads and on page 2 of the December/January issue is an outdated coupon. Paid the bill but still getting notices.,2

fun to read. good price,4
Ordered for my wife for Christmas. She enjoys Sudoku. It was a good gift.,4
"Too much of it is other stuff and beginner level puzzles.  Only a few in each issue are medium to hard, and no really hard ones.",3
This magazine has a lot of graphic sexual content and political bias that I don't want my kids exposed to. Just as well they don't like it anyway,1
I have an active subscription which i cant download,1
My daughter didn't like this magazine - she flipped thru it once and was bored.,2
There is really no reason to buy this magazine when all of the content is on-line (including all of the best stuff that doesn't make it to print).,1
I buy this every year for my sister's husband who's way into building crawlers. He reads it cover to cover.,5
Not a great magazine. Don't like the slick cover.,1
This is a renewal! The best magazine I have found....tons of information that you can USE!,5
"Got an unwanted advertising notification, tried to find where to turn it off, couldn't, so I guess you must accept it like it or not",1
All good.,4

Regards,
Betty McCloy",1
"The delivery was quicker than expected. The magazine is as I expected. Well represents O style - elegant, classic, something for all price ranges, beautiful and practical items",4
If is possibly I assign 0 stat. The diagramation and graphics are a shame. I feel very disappointed that amazon offer a magazine for kindle in such low standard.,1
error words and format,1
Good to get updated fact & figure,4
I love the print but why no version for the MS Surface??? Totally ridiculous. The Surface is a VERY popular tablet. They need to do some development there I think.,1
We cancelled this.,1
The magazine never appeared on my kindle.,1
Not formatted for K-Fire 8.,1
"Great coverage of current events, I look forward to reading it weekly.",4
I bought this for my brother & he loves this magazine.,5
I'm afraid I'll have to cancel. You can't view the magazines using Kindle Cloud Reader on PC or Mac. I always practice my guitar in front of my PC the phone is to hard to see.,1
"The magazine is ok, but erratic subscription delivery.  $22 for only 6 issues is a bit steep, even for a niche sport.  I never know when I'm going to get an issue, or how many.",3
Yes digital machinist met my expectations.,4
"As this is my 1st time on this Magazine I enjoyed it thus far, plus it's very informative for me as my interests have turned to Technology of the day.",4

"My grandson only received 3 magazines and as of the date 03/11/18, still trying to settle this.",1
Great waiting for more,5
Anti conservative.  I read false advertising it would be fair.  Buyer beware.,1
Not the best issue.,2
The best magazine written for progressive values,5
Love readers digest!,5
"Love readers digest
And I don't have to wait for it in the mail",5
I like it a lot so far.,4
Wish they would focus on old trains and not rhe new electronic stuff. It was much better when it first came out.,3
A very expensive magazine; does not offer too much,3
the magazine is good. kindle/android format only not pc accessible. .,3
Best Trains magazine hands down!!,5
"The magazine is very interesting. However, it is more suited to the scientific community than the general public.",4
"Sent them a customer form and check mid 2017
  Stoll waiting for first issue.  And yes, they will get a call shortly.",1

"Love it.
Great magazine.",5
"Great patterns.
Full of creative ideas.",4
"Mostly very difficult--I'm pretty high intermediate, but these were mainly hard & also weren't things I'd use.",2
Awesome magazine!!! Thank you very much! My son just loves your magazine and was thrilled when the first issue arrived!,5
SINCE MY ORDER OF 6/1 STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE FIRST ISSUE FROM SUBSCRIPTION TO RC MAGAZINE???,1
"I have subscribed to the journal for almost 10 years, and continue to find it an invaluable resource! It's so accessible, while remaining comprehensive.",5
"It's good. Not awesome, but it's good.",3
Just wasn't enough for me. Something seems to be lacking. Maybe ideas on how to make life simpler for a busy working mother of 2.,3
"It's a great magazine, but 29.95 is the price that's also offered in the magazine tear-out. Amazon, you can do better than that.",3
More of an adventure and off road motorcycling book than a touring book. Covering those subjects it's great - but I do road touring so for me this mag is not a good fit.,3
By the time it arrives to your house all the articles are dated and all the anime has come and gone. Takes too long to receive.,2
i do not like,1
There is some good info in this I F YOU ARE LEARNING TO MANAGE YOU $$$,4
My husband really loves when this magazine comes in the mail.,5
Magazine is pretty thin. Good Q&A but not worth the cover price (to me).,3
"Well, according to this magazine, all tough women are liberal and angry. This magazine is full of propaganda.",1
"You have to wait 3-4 months , and even then it's out of date",1
Nice..thanks,4
"I love the magazine because I'm a watch collector. The item was priced right, arrived in a timely manner and the shipping costs were great. Thank You.",5
Far superior to the American version. The photography is absolutely beautiful and you learn lots about rural life in England.,5
Not really what I am looking for. Slick magazine but not for me.,3
"Interesting magazine, with useful ideas that can be carried out easily. Always presents the latest trend in decoration.",4
Dpi when zoomed in is grainy on text. I love the concept and will look for my other magazines here. Apple should have done this also. Worth the 99 a month,4
"I ordered this magazine in March and have never seen a copy.  Yet, it's still being advertised.  Has the magazine gone out of business?",1
How would I know if I like it or not? I haven't seen an issue since subscribing several months ago.,1
Got the first issue yesterday (02/28/13) Enjoyed it.  Size if the magazine is thinner than it used to be.  But I will look forward to it,4
My mom loved this magazine and cant beat the price compared to in store,5
Love this magazine !!,5
Yes great,4
Grandma love it!,5
"I have yet to receive my first issue, so I am unable to comment on this publication.  What's the hold-up?",1
"Half the pages are drug adverts.
Not much content. Articles are meh.",2
"Not at all what I was expecting. Instead of a gay life magazine, it was just ads. Barley any real articles.",2
I didn't like the layout.  Too small for an Fire 7 tablet.,2
Got this subscription for my son. He enjoys the articles that discuss the new games that are being released in the near future.,4
"This magazine is a gem, filled with great writing. If you still like the feel of a print magazine and love basketball, Basketball Times is a must for you.",5
Love the magazine - but I often to not receive the current issue. Seems like it skips an issue about every two weeks.,3
"Good global news,covering politics and business and technology. Some unique stories",4
"I didn't order this. I didn't ask for renewal. I tried to make it stop, but cant.",1
My wife loved this for a gift.. I highly recommend this..,5

Poor history.,1

Amazon subscribed for me!!!! And finally I found out how to cancel it,1

Way too many ads for stuff I really don't care for.  Not enough articles or western US interest material,2

"I am sure it is a great magazine, if I would deer receive what I paid for 5 months and one issue, and no way to contact. Do not buy subscriptions through Amazon",1
"The material seems kind of superficial/lightweight. MIT Technology Review is a much better magazine, so I would recommend that instead.",2
just not the same; won't renew,2
"Not what I was hoping for, only one recipe looked like I would give a try.",1
This a nice colorful magazine loaded with great ideas.,4
"Love, love, Love reading The Daily Word every morning.  Keeps me focused on Truth.  And makes my day better!",5
"Nothing so valuable in here.
To be clear, I read a lot on health.
I have nothing against Dr. Oz, but this seems to just be old recycled material.",2
"Unless you like every decor in your home bright-colored, there is really no point reading this magazine.",2
"Love this magazine, full of wonderful ideas",5
While I like the magazine I struggle finding recipes I can change to take onions out and i am allergic to them.,2
"I love this magazine, and all the recipes",5
"maybe it was just the issue I recieved, but it wasn't like I thought it would be.",3
Good amount of stories to advertisements coming from a highly respected woman.,4
always loved my oprah magazine,5
BEST ARTICLES EVER,5
"This used to be a great magazine, but no more.  There's very little content compared to what it used to be and it's not worth the money.",2
"I love the articles and the writing...and of course, the pictures!",5
My favorite magazine. Fun and informative articles for history lovers. Wish I could download past issues.,5

Terrible.  Complete waste of money!,1
Love all the classic old  sportscar stories,5
My son loves this magazine. It has good stories for kids,5

"Magazine looks like it is printed on recycled shoe rubber, blurry and crap.  Barely any articles anymore, don't bother.",1
"I didn't receive a full year.  I only receive the magazine twice.  It's a good magazine, I just didn't receive it as promised.",1
"I was hoping for more technical than what was there. it seems to be more like ""look how cool this is"" than a technical publication. It's like sport compact car, but for computers.",3
"If you into gaming, into the latest PC tech info, like reviews of hardware rated 1 thru 10, chomp PC builds, get this rag. @ $12 bucks for 2 years its worth every penny",1
Great Mag..!!,4
not interested.,1
too many ads the whole magazine is ads. I cant believe real men dress like that. I just read the product reviews then throw magazines away don't want anyone to think i like guys.,1
"Extremely similar to GQ, same publisher. You aren't going to get anything from this magazine that you don't get from GQ. Similar to GQ, lots of ads and minimal content.",1
Minimal content. A very diffrent magazine than several years ago,3
It's useful if you want to buy tools. At least or a little more than half of articles are power tool and other contraptions reviews. I cancelled my subscription after 3 magazines.,1
"Lots of fashion,and rating new items",3
"-It keeps me up with the lasest PC technology.

-Reviews are very unbiased

"They send to much extra trash with the magazine, the first month came with a renewal notice that my 12 month subscription was about to expire.",1
"I used to love ALLURE, but outgrew it. I decided I am never going to LOOK like anyone in the magazine, nor can I afford the clothes, accessories or makeup in there.",1
Nice Ideas for a handy person.,4
far too many adds  not enought info,2
My only complaint is constantly getting renewal messages in the mail. I received one even before getting the first issue.,4
I think I'll like it. Will wait for future issues.,3
Worth the 99 cents per issue I paid for it.,1
"The magazine is good, but I didn't order a subscription.",3
"Time to leave this one behind, I'm afraid...",1
"Some content was really good, but the adds to content balance just didn't work for me.  Pretty sure it was at least 60/40 ads to content.",3
"I love the magazine, but the sale adds are starting to take up half the magazine.",3
Way to many ads but cool project in each magezine,4
"Tooooooo many ads, first 45 pages all ads then table of contents then more ads",2
It was a great issue but could be more effective if articles were less lenghty,4
pretty good magazine except not a lot of articles,3
"Not interested, too many adds.",2
I only received 3 (THREE) copies of my subscription. I fill ripped oft!,1

Hubby likes it,4
Thought this magazine would be similar to Cosmo but unfortunately I was wrong. It seems kind of boring to me.,2
Just received my January issue and it seems to have a lot less pages than it did before.  It was only $5 for the year but won't be renewing it when the year is up.,3
would buy again,1
"Lots of ideas, decorating, recipes",4
Ratio of advertising to articles and ideas is 15-1.  So sad.,1
to me Glamour is more of a young crowd targeted magazine. Liked its relationship columns or whatever you call it.,3
magazine has too many adds not enough mens health,3
"A short magazine with overly simply articles. Number of ads seems more than normal.
Love the web site and very disappointed in this magazine.",2
to many ads,2
good read,4
"Keeps me interested... But the fashion is all incredibly high priced, not something you can ever afford, which sucks.",1
Inteeesting.,1
The little bit of content in the magazine is great. There are way too many ads in it now. I have a few years worth of old issues and they were great. Now not so much.,3
Magazine is ok.  Seems like the ads are more numerous than the articles.,3
"Only have received one magazine, not impressed with this one",1
Most of what I seen was lots of advertising...rather have the real magazine..,3
Not very interesting.,2
"Seems like a very informative magazine, however we are not able to view a readable size from our Amazon fire.  Probably works well on other devices.",3
I ordered this magazine and did not receive one single issue.,1
I think there are a lot of useless articles.  The cabbage recipes were unappetizing.  I was glad I didn't buy it.,2
"Helpful advise, and great articles.",4
I wasn't able to read it on my desktop. :(,1
"A pretty good magazine however, I find I don't read it very much and it just lays around four months and months. I will not renew. Sorry",3
"It's a magazine... is there really reviews on those??

 Yea is an pretty nice magazine.  Has all kinds of magazine stuff in it...",3
Gave it as a gift that had been asked for. I apologized for the content and he agreed it was not what he had expected.,3
"This is the same reason I stopped buying the printed version years ago, more informative articles are required...especially for the everyday man.",4
"Articles were very good and informative, just too much advertising and not enough usable material to make it very interesting.",3
"As with Popular Mechanics, a bit disappointed.",3
Very rudimentary publication. Would not order again.,2
Expected more substance.,3
Good content--just wish there was more of it!,4
Too expensive for little substance,1
a lot more ads and much less continent than i remember from previous years.,2
"Good. Not as diverse as would like, but still a good idea magazine",3
"This publication illustrates some good reasons why science and politics make strange bedfellows. Then again, the title should have warned me.",3
a ton of adds and so far - nothing new,1
"Did not like this magazine, to much advertisements",1
Just what I was looking for!,4
Good information regarding ideas for homes remodeling,4
"Ordered back in November 13 2015  - says 4-6 weeks on the details page.  as of this date, no magazine.  Not good.",1
Get this for husband and his brother.  They really enjoy talking about the articles.,4
50-60% advertisements. I guess that is why it only costs $5 a year...,1
very educational,4
I have tried and tried to get Julys issue on my kindle with no avail,1
"Nice magazine...great interactions, but past issues don't stay on the device.  I have to keep downloading, and download times are forever!",4
"I look forward to checking the latest issue every month.  With this new edition, the magazine has been downloading for 3 days.  It is a technical problem.",4
"I subscribed most of my adult life.  I finally discontinued because the magazine is now more ""Popular People of Science""  and less about the science itself.",1
Better homes and gardens is a very enlighting book. I find the articles very informative and the recipes very good,4
Not enough stories to many advertisements,2
The font was too small I Found it hard to read .and it was too liberal I did not beleave a lot of what was written.,3
"I have mixed emotions about this magazine, not sure I like the twist on some of the articles!
I read it and form my own opinion!",4
The articles were not well written nor were they particularly topical. Would not recommend for the thoughtful reader od ant political persuasion,1
Decent mag,3
Graphics are nice but woodworking projects are too advanced for my abilities and not that interesting.,3
I did not renew my subscription. The writing and topics just weren't that good.,1
The magazine is so thin -- not much articles to read in this issue.  Will the coming issues also be this thin?,2
"I like the magazine, but still have not received a print issue, as of yet.",1
"I liked the magazine, but did not wish to commit myself at this time/",3
I found the point of view from this journal much too conservative for my taste.  It is probably best for libertarians.,3
Watch out for the advertising,1
Not to action packed. I wish I didn't subscribe,1
"Years ago tis was a nice and good magazin. Today is not so.
I do not know why is this so.",1
"This is not the Better Homes my mom subscribes to.  Not by far. Fancy photos, good color suggestions, but all too  impractical.",2
"I love the magazine, but there are too many advertisements. I would rather pay more for the magazine to have more articles and less advertisements.",3
Mostly advertisements for rich people and the rest is liberal.,2
I really enjoy reading about events in the area. The articles are relevant and touching. My husband and I both enjoy reading it.,4
Not much to it anymore.  Not like I remember,3
"This magazine has some interesting things in it, but each issue is very, very short/small... there isn't much to it.",3
ITS OVER 1/2 FULL OF ADVERTISEMENTS.I WILL NOT RENEW MY SUBSCRIPTION,1
Too many advertisements every month. Not enough reading stories,2
perhaps my expectations were too high.  Disappointed.,2
Product was as described and shipping was very fast,4
Predictable hacks.,3
Its an ok mag.,3
"Given as a gift. We have heard no feedback.
Must have not impressed the recipient.",1
I was disappointed with the content of the magazine. I guess it was a little to high brow for me.,3
"way too many ads, and not enough articles.",2
"Great content, but somewhat awkward to manage in a small Kindle Fire format. I'm still in the free 30 day period and am trying to get used to the new method of reading this work.",4
Some good articles without the typical right wing hate but I would not bother to subscribe or recommend it to anyone.,3
The Family Handyman is fun to read but in order to do the projects you need to be more than just handy and have your own toolshop and about a thousand dollars of tools.,4
You may get frustrated with some of the editorials and opinions if you are conservative but the articles about Texas will keep you coming back.,3
Too small for iPhone.  Should have been reformatted.  Probably OK for a full size tablet.,3
Not bad. Certainly worth the low price.,4
This mag needs a new editor. I haven't seen anything interesting in Better Homes for six months. Maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests.,1
heavily weighted with advertisements,2
Good magazine.  I like it.,4
"Great magazine with home planning ideas. Terrible delivery, received first issue over 2 months late with no explanation!",1
Nice magazine with ideas.,4
"This is a great magazine that is filled with wonderful ideas, unfortunately the ideas are not affordable to the average household.",4
like every other home mag. but nice pics,4
Too many ads !,3
I was disappointed as I don't travel on quite the grand scale they cater to.  I cancelled after 5 mos. as I couln't find anything appliable to my style.,1
They are some interesting articles even though the magazine is very flat.,3
"Good magazine, with lots of interesting info and trivia on various places in Texas, and the way of life there.",4
got back to the 70s really ugly ideas,2
I think its a good magazine except there are too many ads in it. Lots of good projects in it though.,4
I don't like it.  It focuses too much on what the stars are wearing and not enough stories.  I won't renew it.,3
I did not like the magazine.  Cancelled the subscription after about 15 minutes. Lots of ads and not much to read. Sorry.,1
Still has too much advertising for the regular price of the magazine.  Not sure if I will renew or buy in future on regular basis.,3
Most of the magazines were mainly filled with pictures and not many interesting articles to read.,2
Way too many ads in this magazine and not enough travel content for the regular traveler.  I won't renew this subscription when it's time.,2
a gossip magazine that is good only to kill time,4
Good to read,4
"For a good price, this is a nice magazine for travelers to have.  Mainly its use is as an idea generator.",4
NOT TARGETED FOR TEENAGERS,1
We enjoy skimming the magazine to get decoration ideas for our house. Some of the ideas presented are interesting! If you are looking for ideas you might enjoy this magazine.,4
Going to cancel. Surface news not substance.,1
I like the magazine and have read it for several years.  Get a lot of good ideas but it often leads me to the big box home improvement stores where I spend money I don't have.,4
ENJOY READING,4
I like the magazine but reading it electronically is not for me.,3
"It's a nice magazine but not enough in them these days to warrant a renewal.  If cheap enough, it is worthwhile.",3
I was hoping there would be inspiring photos however most photos are so staged that it is not practical in real everyday life design.,2
I currently subscribe to this magazine and don't want to order a new subscription to have it available on my kindle.  Bad call.,1
mostly advertisements,2
"Good magazine, nothing spectacular.",3
much to many ads and less stories,3
This is a quality product that is more than marginal. It is written in an easy to read manner. The ideas and projects are nothing special.  I would recommend this product.,4
It was a Christmas present and did not start until weeks later per email. It's middle of January and still not receive it?,1
The renewal subscription started before my current subscription ended.,1
Downloaded this to my android tablet. It opened for 2 seconds then closed. Downloaded again - same problem. I bought Clarkesworld and Galaxy at the same time and those are fine.,1
"In my opinion, it doesn't have alot of content and might as well subscribe to their facebook page and get it there for free",3
This may be good for someone else. But it was not for me. I think I got one and have no idea when or if the next one will come. Not a magazine I look forward to coming.,1
Loved it. Had time to reflect and use the strokes outlined. Took some of the pages and started a book to refer to.,4
This magazine used to be cutting edge...  now its one big advertisement... 34 full page adds out of 88 for one issue... its soI used to look forward to each issue.  Not anymore!,3
I ordered this magazine on 11/30 -- it is now 2/1 and it still has not arrived.  Can't really rate the magazine since I haven't gotten it yet.,1
"Great content, but Kindle format is no good.  Kindle formar too hard to use for magazines.  This mag needs its own app, like the excellent Business Week app.  Am returning it.",3
Cancelled my intended subscription because articles were not to my liking.,1
This book had some neat projects in it. I will be making the work bench this winter. I have all the tools to complete the job.,3
Perhaps regular readers of this magazine aren't bothered by the ads but I found that this magazine contained more advertisements than actual reading material and projects.,3
"I wish it didn't have so many ads, but I enjoy the other content.",3
It is a good item for the guys to read,4
A lot of ads.  Years ago I enjoyed this magazine.  It is not the same.,2
Articles are short,3
great value for a 2 year subscription,4
Excellent magazine. Very poor Kindle Fire port.,1
"Although the magazine is great, it takes Amazon almost 3 months from the order date until the first issue is received. That is an unheard of amount of time to process any order!",3
"This used to be a great weekly, but now it is hard to tell the ads from the news.  This is intentional.  I will not renew my subscription.",2
"Bought this as a stocking stuffer.  My husband said he liked some of the articles, but wouldn't buy it again.",3
"Newsweek used to be a pretty good, balenced magazine. Now it's about 60% ads 30% pictures and 10% ""news"" that always seem to be written like an editorial. Don't recommend anymore.",3
I don't think they synced with my current subscription like they stated. They would ...so one star....I like the magazine a lot...,4
"over 50% advertisements, like a comic book, not a mag",2
Am a long time reader. Home Theater is a great publication. Just not sure why the magazine isn't supported on Kindle of Android...,3
The magazine itself was a good read. I now have a very expired magazine I can't get rid of.,4
"Love the magazine, get it in print. FireHD is ok but slightly text is small and resolution a little blurry. Selective zooming works but it is a little lackluster.",3
wish I hadn't subscribed to it.,4
Not really what I thought it was. Not much in the magazine on computers and tech items. Would not recommend to anyone interested in computer components.,3
"Pretty good content, but too much ads",3
It was kind of a turn off this publication leaned to far left a couple of times. I wish they would stick with lifestyle and less with politics.,3
"If you must read a news magazine, read Time....it's a lot better!",3
It's a pretty boring magazine. Does not have too many good topics.,3
"Good magazine for a teen, not quite there for an adult, mostly ads and a few fluffy articles which can be summed up in a headline",3
Lots on thick ad inserts make it hard to get to the important stuff.  I will not renew!,1
was hoping for more real life fashion.,3
Cheap paer,4
I thought there would be much more journaling.  It is all pictures.  Not my cup of tea at all.,2
The magazine is thin more like a pamphlet. Like a pamphlet it has a ton of advertisements in it. I don't bother reading it anymore.,1
Gift for my dad. He likes it better than popular mechanics,4
"Some issues are great;others are rather mediocre.  Still, it is probably worth the subscription price for those interested in keeping abreast of scientific developments.",4
Nothing more or less than I expected,1
disappointed as I received one issue then was told there would be no more...,1
Magazine content was a little light. Mag must have gone out of business as order was cancelled and outstanding money refunded.,1
Don't like that you can only read the magazine vertically instead of horizontally. I have the iPad 12.9 and it would just be more comfortable if vogue had the option. :(,3
"Too many ads,  very little content.",2
Not much to say -- Another Photography rag,2
Way too  many  add's ..,2
not enough info,2
Magazine content will only be delivered to iphones and andriods. I don't have those so I sort of just made a $6 donation. Don't buy digital magazines.,1
This magazine has nothing to do with Vogue patterns except the name.,1
"Took well over a month to get here, but it has lots of helpful articles",4
Poor content related magazine.  I never really was engaged by any of the articles.,1
"Interesting, but no longer a guide to the newer technologies.",3
"I love the magazine. The renewal seemed to take a long time, though.",4
"Got this here instead of re-upping by mail as I normally do.  I've been reading it most of my life, so is that recommendation enough?  =)",3
"I read this magazine almost cover to cover each issue. The articles are always fresh and sometimes predict the future of aviation ,cars, and technological advancements",4
Magazine has a ton of ads.,1
Too liberal. Leave politics out of technology reporting.,1
I really enjoy the magazine.  My only thing is I enjoy reading on my tablet but for this magazine I can't adjust the type so it makes it hard to read.,4
"Always a great magazine but I don't want the printed version thank you.......
Please don't make this any more difficult....",1
"There are some articles that are not so new to some of us, but once in a while there is something interesting that keeps me paying this mag's subscription.",3
Do not like the page set-up for my Kindle.  Prefer Comso's flexibility.  (why the hell is there a limit on how many words you can post-now thats dumb),1
"Unfortunately downloading Vogue takes way too much time, something like 1/2 hour and application crashes often. Not very stable application.",1
daughter likes it,4
99% product advertisements than informative articles.,2
Mostly advertisements.,2
"If you're into high fashion, this magazine is for you.  There are way too many advertisements in this magazine when you are reading it.",2
"Always some nice photo shoots, though they tend to go back to grungy a bit often for my taste these days.",3
This magazine is getting a little top heavy in advertising but its a good way to keep up with consumer electronics and events in the tech world.,4
Some nice tips but way beyond me.,3
"Like the magazine, just wish they would have more objective reviews instead of just reiterating what the manufacturer publishes.",4
"Very little how to,  A lot of adds",3
"I really enjoyed the content of this magazine, however, I get a monthly charge of $0.99 and have yet to get any content since my initial subscription.",4
"Too much advertisement ! Not so much things to read.
I will cancel my subscription.",2
"Good magazine, but September will be the last issue they publish.  My wife, the financial person in our house, enjoyed reading it.  Too bad.",3
Not really a magazine for me . Ok maybe for my Neice.,3
Was disappointed .  Contest let them use Photoshop.  I thought a good photographer did it all with camera settings.,2
"This was a gift but the mother of the girl I sent it to was concerned about the content, given she was nave.",3
I got this magazine as a gift and I have to say I don't like it much---it is full of ads and offers no interesting information what so ever.,1
"Got a great price for the subscription,but not sure a monthly magazine can keep up with this up and down market.",3
It's not a magazine for a beginner.,1
I did not like this magazine like I thought I would.  the articles were too advanced and never a consistent theme.  Magazine is too diverse.,2
"Personal preference, I was looking for more on credit cards, ways to save and handling debt. I'm not really into investing. This is a great magazine for those who are though.",3
"Really like it with first issue.  NOW I hear it is going downsize from 6-4 issues a year, bummer",3
I was hoping for a magazine that show cased home business owners and  offered great advice. This is basically a good google search.  Save your money.,4
"Once one of my favorites,  this magazine has deteriorated to the point that after many years,  I know longer subscribe.",3
Lots of learning opportunities for any age reader.  I do not approve of some of the ads for young readers in our school library.,4
I was under the impression that was getting 12  issues for 14.95 . So far all I've received  Is three.,1
"I received 2 issues in my dead mother's name.....can't figure that out...she's been gone 2 years.
I ordered Dec 4th, today is Feb 16th, still no Smart Money in my name???",1
"Nice cover pictures and headlines, but way too many ads.  There's a reason its only twelve bucks, this is an ad-sponsored mag.",3
This publication is hard to read on my kindle with my vision. It may be fine for someone with 20/20 or better vision. My vision is only correctable to 20/40,1
"Wish I had not mailed my check.  Most boring magazine I
Have ever seen. Anorexic models with pouty faces, none of
Them happy with life, I guess. Please
Refund my money.",1
"just not my type of magazine my mom got it for me and some of the articles are ok, but it is too fashion and makeup focused for my tastes.",3
A lot advertising. I didn t find many interesting articles.  Will not renew my subscription. Different than what I thought.,2
We bought this subscription as a gift for our 16 year old daughter without having seen an issue of it. There was way too much (sexual) info in it. Cancelled it.,1
really could not give an accurate review becasue I have not received my first issue yet.,1
"My husband likes it ok but does not want to renew it, after many years of reading this magazine he feels like it has not been updated.",3
"This magazine is cool, but seems shallow. I wish they went more in depth. Still, an interesting read every once in a while.
I recommend still.",4
This magazine seems to get thinner every year with more space taken up by Copenhagen and Skoal ads than actual articles. A Legendary publication that needs more substance back.,3
This magazine changed over the years. It went from reat good stories and advice to just a bunch of gossip and nonsense.,2
Not quite what I was expecting.,2
"Interesting, informative articles and exotic recipes.",4
good magazine it just never shows up on time,4
Meh. Thin mag. Not sure if I would subscribe again. I find at least one article that applies to my interest.,3
Not as interesting as I hoped for...!!!,3
it's a good news for loyal fans of the magazine like me. though it'd be pity that no international offer currently..,4
My daughter has not started receiving the magazine. When will she start getting it. I ordered it in December.  ?????,1
Very fashion oriented good for younger audience..,4
didn't get many issues,1
Changed for the worse. Has definitely lost some of its class and polish. This charter subscriber will finally be canceling.,2
Great magazine with wonderful tips and trends but never as good as the hard copy version. Great for travel though.,4
I renewed 3 time in a year.  The auto-renewal kick in after 5 mos.  I cannot cancel the order.  Don't do auto renewal.,1
"Nice magazine but too many adds,not enough consideration for non leather no animal tested products.",3
Subscribed once again to get the latest tech and science info. Always very well written and concise. Very little advertising and amazing articles. Recommended buy.,4
This is my drool magazine.  I wish I could afford the clothes so I have to put together looks that I like for less.  One of these days.....,1
"I like this magazine, however it has t6oo many advertisements!",3
"Seems to be simply a copy of Outdoor Life with a few changes, only.",3
"too many adds, not enough content",3
"This is a good magazine to read. There are better science magazines out there, but they cost more money. This is a good deal for the price.",4
"I'd prefer to be able to renew or not on My say-so, and not just be automatic. Can you fix it for me?",3
"I used to like your articles. Now seems too much hi priced fashion, too little reality, in this needy world.",2
"never anyting in it I am interested in  Certainly nothing suits our lifestyle, don't know hat more to say, bad choice.",1
"A gift to my son, this one he wanted, I selected a few more for him, which he enjoyed greatly",4
"This magazine is not as interesting as I had hoped, but my greatest complaint is that the fonts are very hard to read.",3
I love this magazine in print but I like my Kindle magazines to have interactive material. Recipes have beautiful pictures and there are interesting articles in every issue.,4
"This particular issue was the worst all around even the ads were horrible. blah. This is my fave mag, I hope its just a one month miss.",1
A great magazine to read and study with a good variety of  subject fields but a little too heavy on the green agenda. For the most part very intriguing,4
"The Magazine is great, nevertheless my physical address was lacking information the senders (POPULAR SCIENCE) so, I only received 4 issues of a 1 year subscription.",3
It's too bad that they have succumed to pushing the leftist political agenda. It used to be a great magazine. I'm not renewing my subscription.,1
ITS BEEN ALMOST A YEAR AND I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY FIRST ISSUE. NEVER CONTACTED ME. HORRIBEL COMPANY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.,1
"I will not renew it. I subscribe to many other food/cooking magazines, so I definitely have others to compare it to. It does not have the kind of recipes I would make.",3
"That's pretty much all. It was supposedly coming on April 26, but it's been ~10 days. Kind of starting to doubt it will arrive.",3
All it is is advertizing.,1
"it's a good magzine I recomend it I have not got a issue yet i hope I do
get it soon",1
I purchased this to see trends in color and styles of jewelry since I create wearable art. Not many pictures of models wearing jewelry.,3
I still get Marie Claire. But don't read that of often.,4
"Ok, I ordered this for my daughter. Too wild for me.",3
Wasn't impressed.  I'm hoping this is a glitch and the following issues will be better,2
Not sure why Im getting this.  I got a bill and the magazine all of a sudden,1
Magazine is very boring.  Too many advertisements and not enough articles.,2
Don't care for the magazine at this time.,1
About 50% ads.,1
"She likes it, that is all that matters to me. Like the old saying, ""If mama is not happy, no one is  happy"".",3
"Marie Claire is a great magazine.  However, I may have aged out of their demographic.  Prefer reading Vogue and Harper's Baazar.",3
"The magazine is good, good put together, easy to open with any device. No zoom when you open inner pages. Not my style of articles, too superficial.",4
I've read other magazine and liked them better. It wasn't horrible but I'm not going to miss not getting it,3
I wish there was more fashion,3
"Lots of lovely photos, great ideas, deco tips and food.",4
I enjoy this magazine.  I have been a subscriber for many years.,4
"Great for laymen interested in technology.  VERY heavy on advertising, light on news and products.",4
Way too many ads basically when you take all of them out there's not much left,2
Too many drug ads.,2
I have not received a single issue however I did get a card from PS saying that the delivery would begin later (more than 6 weeks) than advertised because of demand.,1
Same as sunset too much advertising,3
didn't find much in it,2
Not what I expected.,2
Good but not great.,3
Didn't sign up for auto-renewal and don't want it! Please make it stop! The magazine is a waste of money? OK! I'll repeat do not spend your money,1
"It would probably have been a good magazine, but I never received a single issue, so who knows ?",1
Informative,4
So far am pleased,4
Used to be so much better. WHAT HAPPENED?,3
"There's really not much real, actionable content.",2
nice magazine,3
"I like this subscription for this year, but I probably won't renew.  There are some useful articles, but I like Woman's Day better.",3
Good magazine choice. I enjoyed the articles and the recipes. The money saving tips were also greatly informative.would recommend to women.,4
Feels extremely repetitive with their articles. I feel like I am reading the exact same thing over and over again.,2
i like the New Yorker fine but this version is flawed.  The screen often cuts off the title or part of the test.  Cannot read cartoons.,3
Too much to read in mmy time frame,3
This magazine is actually enjoyable and has interesting article. I love to decorate.,4
"Love the front covers, but the rest has a few good articles.",4
"I've been waiting for some time for this to start, and at this point am ready to ask for a refund, since it appears that the subscription doesn't include any actual issues.",1
Not as good as it used to be.  Hope it will improve.,3
Every other page feels like its an ad. Most of the writing is pretty good. I wish they featured more clothing that didn't cost hundreds of dollars.,4
"Auto renewal for magazines is a bad idea, because Amazon does not tell you what price they are renewed at.",1
"Too much politics, too little men's fashion.",3
Mostly advertising in the magazine.,3
"The premier Anti-Cop, Anti-Military, Anti-American LGBTQ ""Queer"" magazine in America.
But the pages do make good paper to wipe one's behind.",4
It's ok but I don't want the magazine to much advertising.,3
"All it is ads. Very few interesting articles. Like Playboy, get it for the photos.",3
To much liberal bias.,2
"Not my kind of magazine, I would rather read Mother Earth News",3
"Nice but repetitive. No big changes from month to month. See the same over and over. I used to love this magazine, but now it's dull.",3
Articles are not that interesting. Would not recommend this magazine to the average reader.,2
"Cover stories weight thin in quality, waaaaay to many ads!",3
"Country Living has changed to the point where after all of these years, I not going to re-new my subscription.",1
"Classic and informative with insight analysis about culture, the arts, politics, people and some important national and global news.",4
GQ is hit or miss sometimes.,1
Not as good as the one I get from the Newsstands it has more adds it seems boring to me,3
"It's really for new Yorkers, I live in savannah",3
Good magazine but overpriced for the amount of stories they developed. Purchased at Amazon my favorite store with gift card.,4
"Close to what I had hoped for for, but misses the mark too many times. Now to add 5 more words tp keep the site happy.",3
I ordered this magazine along with another.  The other magazine came one month before this one.  I don't understand .....why so late.,1
I was looking for ideas for my own home not other homes in this magazine. I live in a rural area and would like to find items for that kind of area.,1
Contemporary enlightenment from serious relevant interests to my humor satisfied!,4
To much advertising.  Most of the pages are advertising for medical ads not one page but two complete pages.  I do not want to read that in a magazine.  Will not renew next year.,2
"I have subsribed to all the r/c mags for some time.

This mag has become a glorified catalog for the adertizers.

it used to be a real good mag once.",4
"When I first got an email telling me my auto-renewal was ready, it said the price would be $8. But when I committed, it said the price was $12. Kindof a ripoff.",1
"Of course I will have to wait a year to see what happens but when I tried to cancel an auto renewal on another magazine, what a hassle! Will wait and see how this one goes.",1
I have not received this and it was promised for delivery the first of the month.  It is now the middle of the month.,1
"If you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead.

If you want better exercises and articles look to Oxygen or Women's M&F",3
"has been impossible to access back issues, tho I see they are attempting to remedy this.  Not enough articles of interest to me to make it worth the price.  I am not renewing.",2
"I'm told the magazine is good for little people, but am sad that my grandson has to wait until mid March to receive the first copy of his Christmas present.",3
This has just turned into a gossip and boasting magazine. No longer seems relevant for the investor.,1
All is as expected.,3
They need to put in more effort into the kindle edition. The content available are very underwhelming as compared to the hardcopy..,1
"Not that good, but still good.",3
"Great magazine but the reading engine i don't really like it, is not that intuitive. I have more magazines on my ipad and they are definitely better.",3
"hardly ever receive the copies of this magazine, not sure whos fault, the seller or my international forwarder....  boh keep pointing at each other....",1
since when is a one year monthly subscription only ten issues,1
it was a gift.  but i love the magazine.,3
not much content anymore. it is all ads. seems the articles are crafted to try and place more products in article.,3
It's not the greatest. Like all mags nowadays it's mostly all adds. Most of the info offered is all free online.,3
"no where near as good as it used to be
I would not recommend",3
Don't waste your money!,1
Its always interesting!,4
Mostly ads.,2
"Could be ok, but too much advertising. Seems they get paid by clothing companies to be their models, too",3
I have yet to begin receiving this magazines issues-I ordered this approximately 8-10 weeks ago.,1
A little disappointed. I guess I was hoping for something closer to the original.,3
Seems like much space is devoted to car reviews. Might want to look askance at the title of your magazine.,3
dislike the consumer color scheme; difficult to read especially if color blind; review was written previously re this.,1
This is only available on the kindle fire hardware. No Android. No iOS. Completely worthless unless you own Amazon supported devices. Was forced to cancel my subscription.,1
"More ads than articles, and even the few articles are basically ads themselves.",2
Too hard to read on cell phone. Content very good.,4
Not as in depth and interesting as it used to be.,3
"Way to many ads, not enough information or articlies that really represent anything of value.
Was once a very enjoyable magazine to read!",2
"I am frustrated that I get an online subscription with my print subscription, but I must pay for it to use it in my Kindle Fire.",1
Could do with waaaaaaay more articles and less ads,1
Yes Ill give five stars to this product because this is functional and works well.,4
Too many adds.,3
"Not what I was expecting.  Seems like a compilation of varied ""things"" I was expecting something different.  Seems like a US Govt cartoon safety manual.",2
"Cant view on mac osx, can view on my tiny ass HTC10, disapointmented",1
Alot of advertising,4
Almost all ads.  Waste of $.,1
Seems like this publication has gone down hill. Not noteworthy as previous years. Reviews marginal at best.,2
Good magazine but ordered in early December and got the first issue in March.  Absurd.,3
Not like it used to be to many advertisements not enough content.  The older issues were worth reading.  Will not renew.,2
Not as easy to navigate as the real magazine.,3
some issues contain useful informations but some others are just useless...,3
Very pleased.,4
"The kindle edition does not work on the kindle E-readers, but from reading other reviews maybe that is a good thing.",3
Not my interest,2
received as expected,4
They started me out with old editions.,3
It is a decent magazine.  Gives guidelines for workouts and eating habits but after a year you're reading the same information just written differently.,3
Mostly adds hardly any good content,3
"Pretty good magazine. The only thing I don't like is their Buy and Hold strategy, which is dangerous, especially if you're nearing retirement, or have retired.",4
"Subscription started right away.  Wish I had subscribed to CR sooner.  Always clipping an article every month for long term storage,",4
This Good publication is somewhat deminished by inaccurate information.  What an awful shame that sponsor money seems to dictate opinion.,1
"Love the magazine, but it is not for an Android. The other items are great, but this one displays the whole page.",3
What can be said about a magazine?  It down loaded without problems and it was the issue I wanted.  Nothing glamorise,1
You literally have to find contents from loads of advertisements.,1
Dumbing down & cheapening.,1
"I thought this magazine was about science?  Rename it ""Global Warming Monthly"".  Honestly, they find a way to squeeze it into the magazine every month.  RUBBISH.",1
"I love the magazine, but why can't I subscribe to it on my Kindle??? Why did they choose not to be available in e-reader format?",1
"I like Consumer Reports, but I don't like that I don't get full access to their website even though I subscribe to the magazine.",3
It's just pdf or image files of the regular magazine. No effort put into making it usable on a tablet.,1
"My niece was suppose to receive in March, now they are saying April",1
was unable to get the free copy on kindle after purchesed hard copy and have it mailed to me monthy,1
"The only thing I do not completely comfortable is too much commercial.
Issues are good. :}",3
Excellent magazine to update oneself on current scientific developments. Weird collection of ads though for a science oriented journal!,4
"Wasn't worth the subscription. I found the magazine to be bland, full of ads and basically boring. All the information can be found doing a quick web search. Highly Disappointed.",1
"read Popular mechanics for years, the digital layout is terrible compared to many others",1
Too many ads. Just a few articles.,3
seems like there are a lot of articles written to people on the cusp of retirement. would be nice to see more diverse articles.,4
Would not order a magazine agin to hard to read.,1
To me its not the magazine it used to be. I now quite often find it very confusing.,2
good price,4
my 12 year old prefers popular science,4
"I have been a subscriber for over 30 years and I won't be renewing.  While pricing has gone down, I would gladly pay more for same quality as before.",1
I have found that Kiplinger's is written for the everyday investor better than most other financial magazines I have looked at.,1
"The jury is still out on this one.  Some issues are very interesting and helpful,
while others are long, boring and rather useless.",1
"Contents are just like the printed version. BUT, why more expensive than the printed (and mailed) version. Makes no sense!",1
I haven't read PM in a few years. Not as good as it use to be. I use to have better content.,3
I feel like these magazines have more advertisment than actual articles.,4
"Once again a very informative story from a magazine you would not expect to cover such a very technical subject.
Further proof of a magazine well worth haveing.",4
This magazine does still have some useful information if you search among it's many many pages of advertising. Good Luck.,4
too much advertisement,2
"A staple in any man's periodical library.  It should just be issued with the dangly bits at puberty.  Even so, the content has slipped a bit over the years.",3
I can read and peruse the entire magazine in 10 minutes.  Nothing of interest and the recipe section is pathetic.,1
magazine arrives timely.  But the articles itself are not interesting to me.,2
"Does not allow text only views on the Android, so it its very cumbersome to read the extremely small print.",2
Articles are not relevant to me as I am eighty years old and do not live in the U.S. anymore.,1
Not the mag it used to be,2
"Just ordered this magazine.  I actually took the time to count 68 full page ads in a 144 page issue. That's nearly 50%, or for every full page there is a full page advertisement.",1
Magazine was super thin. Too many ads. Not what it used to be. I canceled immediately.,2
"I thought I remembered that it was about homes, but it has a lot of fashion, makeup, etc. as well.",3
Read it all in short time.  Informative but limited number of subjects in this volume. Recommend it for light reading.,4
"It's nice, but too many ads.",3
Too many advirtisements did not like it,2
Practically all advertising.  Nothing like it used to be. Hardly any good articles.  I am very disappointed.,1
To many ads,3
"RECEIVING PAPER COPY, NOT INCLUDED ON PAPERWHITE. WISH SOMEONE HAD SOMETHING ABOUT THAT ON THE DESCRIPTION. i WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE FIRE.",1
"Boomers are probably the leading readers of the Mag. We want info. pertaining to us. Also, reprint old jokes, we won't remember them~! lol",1
when I started to read my 1st issue I was shocked to see all the ad's for senior related products. What a horrible mix of boring content and funny and sad advertising.,1
Been a subscriber for years but I do miss them having a short novel each month,4
Too many ads and products reviewed are for the products advertised primarily. Number of pages has decreased by almost half.,2
Has good stories in it. Needs more recipes.,4
Articles were not interesting and to my liking.,2
"It was not enough & interesting as new ideas in Mechanics.
I couldn't find what is a news around the world & US for now.",3
"I went through only one issue and canceled my subscription. advertisements advertisements advertisements, and some short useless columns. I wouldn't recommend.",1
To much advertising y,3
not so sure I would order again,2
"This give s me lots of ideas to do with my grandkids ,the one thing I wish was more craft ideas.",4
"Rate to find a good article. This magazine is all ads. Even the ""articles"" are just selling something.",3
"The magazine is fine when I can get it to work, the problem is that it keeps closing on me so I never get to read it.",3
"Unfortunately, this magazine now has more advertisements than true content and article of interest.",2
It's just okay. Don't expect much when you order it through Amazon for cheap - pretty sure it's about half of their regular issue size.,3
Ordered magazine for my son but I am receiving a copy also. I don't golf.,1
I ordered this for my son. However both he and I are receiving the magazine. I don't golf. Waste of magazine.,1
"Hard to read, much rather have the magazine where you can pick up and look at it whenever in a size easy to read.",4
"I thought the kindle version of the magazine was too expensive, I would not consider purchasing it again. Many thanks.",3
"I enjoyed this magazine. I do have a problem of losing interest after getting a magazine for a length of time, though. It's probably just me, and not the magazine.",3
"Nice pointers, and I do buy goods that carry their seal of approval.  Not the most exciting magazine on the market, but it's alright.",4
"Much as I thought I would enjoy this magazine, there are just too many adverts for junk, I can hardly get myself to open it, and a few have gone straight into the trash!",2
"Seems like every magazine is the same. Someone losing weight, a few recipes, and few product reviews. Nothing really great.",2
"The first magazine arrived quickly, but just not my favorite magazine.  I bought it for the coupons, but there has only been 1 in each of the first 2 issues.",3
"Way overpriced for what it is, only 6 issues. It is a good magazine but not at $40 for 12 issues. Maybe if it was twice the content it might be worth it.",2
"I placed this order on 6-27-08 and today is 8-6-08 and I haven't received my first issue yet. Hopefully, I will receive it soon.",1
The service was quick and accurate except......the gift card made no mention that the gift given was a magazine subscription. The person receiving it had no idea what was given.,1
This was a very easy subscription.  It came in a a timely manner and was much cheaper than anywhere else I could subscribe.,4
I have only received 2 copies of the Guideposts!!!!!! I thought I would receive one each month!,1
I used to subscribe to Guide Posts and have always enjoyed it. Over the years ads have taken over to good reading and shortened the content.,4
Full of ads,1
Wish they wouldnt always put skinny people on the cover show real women we are all sizes even plus size and we workout too,1
"Same as most magazines, too many ads, but there is some interesting and informative articles.",4
"Did not find Health magazine was the one for me. I tried it for 30 days, however, I will. Not purchase it.",1
"It's a semi-boring magazine. Lot's of information, but not a lot of useful information. Can't say it's one I'd buy again and again.",3
"Too many models and celebrities and too many ads. If I looked like a model or a celebrity, I wouldn't need this magazine. Not for the ""Common Jane"".",2
"Wow,  these magazines have shrunk down to one forth their size and half of that is advertisements.",1
The title is misleading. This magazine is all about fitness and dieting. There is very lillittle  little here,1
So far this is not the magazine of my choice.  Life Extension is a million times more informative.,3
"I really like it.  It is simaler to Dr. Oz's The Good Life, so I going with it this year.",4
It is not a good choice for the kindle fire. The print is too small even on the largest font.,1
"I wasn't real impressed with this magazine, nothing major, just didn't pull me in enough to be excited about it when it arrived.",1
It's garbage. Full of adverts/commercials. Just a few health talk or discussion. This is not the Health magazine or journal of those days.,1
"Both Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact & F&SF contain massive amounts of homosexual themed stories.

No wonder their readership is disappearing!",1
The Kindle edition is poor compared to the print edition.  No pictures - more important the lack of new paragraphs when speakers change.  Poor formating.  No more Kindle editions!,1
So many good stories.  I wish I could handle their left wing politics.  Sadly I cannot renew due to that.,4
My granddaughter got me reading this.,4
If only writer's Digest spent as much time creating articles for writers as they did spamming for you to renew your subscription,1
This was a gift and I know that my son had enjoyed having it though he didn't request a renewal,4
Kindle part is GREAT! Received 2 issues - Kindle only. Why Have I not been mailed the print issues? Unhappy about this. Today I will need to call the magazine's customer service.,1
"Lots of ads, and not much meat.",3
"More advertisement than actual journalism
Wasn't what I expected and definitely won't be renewing",2
Great articles and cycle info,4
Too many advertisements distract,2
Took almost two months to get first issue. Does not have much substance. Too much advertising .,1
"Pretty good read. Most frustrating part, most articles are written for moms or from a mom's perspective.",4
"This magazine is really for parents of older, say 6+. Most of the articles and crafts are for bigger kids.
If you have older kids then this is for you- cute crafts.",2
"good magazine, but long time to wait for first issue to arrive - up to 12 weeks",4
I ordered 5 months ago and have yet to receive one issue....,1
"The magazine is being delivered, and I enjoy it, but the Kindle edition never made it. Is it because I have a Kobo tablet?",1
Great reading,4
"Only E magazine I could find quickly about bicycling.  Forgot what a waste/drivel for ths masses this magazine is, don't waste your time.",1
I bought this Magazine for my grandson's High School Graduation. He is enjoying it.,4
Reading this magazine on kindle are not so good (I have the zinio version ),3
"While the content is decent, the inability to read this magazine in the Kindle Cloud Reader where I have a big enough screen to not have to zoom in sours the deal for me.",3
Not getting regularly...,2
"I know there is a lot to tell about running, but this is more ads than anything else.
running shoe section about the new models was oke....just
not impressed,,",3
"Their idea of cheap fashion is under $100. Thats not my idea of cheap, but it might be yours. this magazine just makes me want clothes I will never own.",2
always interesting!,4
They said they sent 2 issues but i never received any of them.  Waited 1 more month & never received single issue.  Called them to cancel subscription & got my money back.,1
A good guide to stay motivated to run,4
"I normally would not buy it, but a year for 5.00, could not pass it up.",1
Maybe it was the subject matter. Just not interesting to me. I have enjoyed the magazine in the past.,3
Way too much advertising not enough articles,2
It's mostly for marathon runners. I do 5K's otherwise good information.,3
"not deep enough on the ""technical"" side.",2
Not at all the quality it was in the past.  Articles are not as well written and seem biased.  I want facts not opinions!,2
USED TO BE a good magazine,3
I'm tired of seeing the Gender Revolution cover too.,3
Slowly evolved over the years to a slick vehicle of advertisements with a few articles sandwiched between. Sad.,2
my son liked it,4
Playboy is history. The articles now in Maxim are much better since there is a new owner/publisher..,1
"Not like it used to be. The entire magazine is mostly designer ads now. None of the good jokes or ""guy"" material anymore. A big dissapointment",2
Just OK. I think Maxim embellishes on some thing to make the stories more attractive. I not a fan of that.,3
"Magazine is ok, but has more advertisements than articles",3
"Magazine great, kindle version not great.",3
",Should be nil.",3
"Ots of good info. As well as good healthy recipes. Also, great personal triumph stories :) cant beat free sjipping and cheaper price then anywhere else!",4
"Used to love this magazine, now its more advertisements then anything else.",1
This magazine used to be fun. Now it's just garbage writing with none of the interesting aspects that made the magazine worth buying.,1
I still have not received anything. The only thing that was done on time was your billing on my credit card. I want a credit back. PLEASE,1
This publication seems to focus more on real estate ads than critical reviews of those locations we might be interested in.,3
JUST SCAN.  DON'T REALLY READ IT.,1
"I don't like they renewed my subscription without telling me. When I tried to cancel it, they told me I was too late.",1
don't subscribe anymore it was ok,3
"This one is won't be interesting for a pro's runners and serios athlets, for beginners it might be ok....",3
"Interesting articles of local interest, but too many tourism ads.",3
I enjoy reading about our beautiful national parks and the photos that accompany them.,4
"Sorry, Magazines just don't work for me on the kindle. Don't like the navigation",1
I just read the first issue.  It wasn't that great.  Hopefully it will get better.,3
I am VERY disappointed with this magazine. The content is weak & the fashion pages are certainly not aimed toward the every-day woman. It's weird & poorly done.,1
Nice articles,4
"Not a bad mag, articles are good and so are the advertisements.",3
"Content seems good, but I was unable to enlarge the pages as I can on most magazines.",3
Too many ads.,2
"There's a little trouble figuring out how to load it, but once you're past that, it's a great way to read the mag. I just wish it were a little easier to navigate.",4
Its not what it used to be.,2
Very good magazine with decent reading materials.,4
enjoying it,3
I didn't much like this magazine at all.  It is very thin and there's not anything very interesting inside.  I would not buy this again.,2
"Somehow this great magazine has fallen down when it comes to interesting articles...I will not be renewing my subscription, sorry to say.",3
DISAPPOINTED,2
It's been going downhill over the past year.,3
I just didn't like it seem like it's filled with advertisements.,3
This was a gift to a friend but he says he enjoys it.,4
"Disappointed with the magazine, not how I remembered it from a couple years ago, not enough articles, too much filler.",2
Not what it used to be,3
Gave as a gift to a friend who would like the stories it provides.  Has a bit of variety.  Entertaining.,4
Not my kind of travel. Too spendy.,2
It's a pretty darn good magazine--only comes every other month--which is fine.  Saves time!  :)  Also not written for the 20 year old.,3
It is a very good magazine. Worthy reading.,4
I think I missed an issue or two but everything is set now and I am receiving my magazine. So I rate the auto renewal a three.,1
I find this magazine interesting and usually containing information I can use.  I pass it on to a neighbor or family member when I finish it.,4
This magazine does not serve the average income family.,1
"Always useful for trip planning, but not a primary source.  Suggestions often far  too expensive for my middle class pocketbook.",4
To much advertisements,3
like this magazine alot. my only request would be more architecture in it. maybe a bit less flowers. keep it up.,3
I was quoted a price of $5.00 and was charged $12.95 for this Travel & Leisure subscription.  I tried to correct it but just finally gave up.,1
Not Great by any means. But still has some good info and articles.,4
I don't feel the articles are as good as they used to be....but.....then...i don't always look at this for the articles.,3
i orderes this book back in feb and still have not got it yet  it just takes to long to get books from  you all,1
This is a good guys magazine.  Some issues are lacking but I tend to find most of them entertaining and sometimes informative.  The subscription was worth the cost.,3
I hope future issues are MORE interesting!  Little eye appeal and most of the articles could put you to sleep.,3
"With all the focus on being young many trends are just not suitable for the older women.
This magazine is a nice guide line so we look good and not silly.",3
This seems to be tailored more for bachelors who are only after a booty call. Too many crass articles and language ffor my married man tastes.,3
whats in this book I already know. Not helpful at all. Wont recommend it to anyone its hard to say anthing else no good!!!,1
As magazines go it's good. Some useful info and product suggestions for we mature women. good reading.,4
"articles are just okay, needs more funny content, always buy magazines on amazon though, best price you can find anywhere.  very few pages, thin magazine",3
The magazine is pretty dull. The stories are not interesting and the interviews are even worse. Dont waste your money!,1
Great tips and articles. It just needs more articles about men. A total mens section would be great. thanks yo,4
Used to be an outstanding mag...now it has been bought and they have sold out the main strength and beauty of the mag...very sad time for National Geo..will never support again.,1
Great magazine until I was completely turned off by a biased unscientific opinion article claiming to be scientific.,1
"I was hoping for recipes, dieting tips, help with overcoming plateaus, but instead got success stories without much assistance for those of us who are still a ""work in progress"".",3
"This magazine used to be good, but now it's like flipping through a catalog.  Even with the cheap subscription, I did not renew.",3
"Loved this magazine during my college days, but then I grew up.  Now I am no longer entertained by half-dressed women, dozens of ads or fashion advice.",3
"good magazine, but the print is too small.  (yes, i really do read the articles.)",3
Very practical information and do not have to be a member of weight watchers to enjoy the benefits of the information in this magazine,4
This was purchased for a man and he likes it very much so I assume it is a good thing.,4
"It's a good magazine, not only does it have beautiful half naked women, but some pretty good articles as well.",3
Have not recovered this at all since ordering.that is the reason for the 3 rating. We have subscribed to this magazine before and really liked it.,1
very nice and fast delivery,4
"The articals lacks in depth information, to be better, it should referance others",2
I like the old magazine app better - this one has been going for a week and still isn't downloaded.,3
Not same quality in recent years in my opinion; regular subscriber since 1971.,2
This magazine really is about the pictures...the articles have no real significance...but is that the point?,3
Great articles and gear review.,4
"Not what I expected but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good magazine, just not what I was looking for",3
Limited in its content value great on its photos and artwork,4
One of the few magazines that I like from month to month. The articles are really interesting and not overfilled with ads like the other usual mens magazines.,3
Bought this for my other half.  He likes it very much.,4
"pretty sure I never read one of these that came in, i don't see the need for someone my age to order this (age 25).",1
"Synapse is disgusting- no refund, no magazines, do not waste your money.",1
"Title says it all. Is it coming, Amazon or what? Next time, order directly through the magazine rather than through a third party like Amazon.",3
I received a coupon from Amazon.com for a year's subscription for $1.  I sure hope it is worth it.  I like it so far.,4
I cancelled my subscription because the format is too difficult.,1
"Pictures are great, it just took me some time to figure out how to move around the website.",4
"National Geographic is very brief and short not like it used to be.
Wouldn't recommend it.",1
I was confused to receive my first issue with three back ordered ones? Pretty bummed because we had already purchased them during our travels.,1
"I didn't find many recipes that appealed to me.  When I read Cook's Illustrated, I can't wait to try many of the recipes.  Lots of advertisement to get through as well.",3
Actually this one I'll cancel,1
"The magazine has improved over the years, but it's still a vehicle to sell franchises. There are some articles worth reading. For $5 for a year it's a no brainer.",3
Way to many ads and not enough useful information....,2
More of advertisements then facts.,3
magazine not for me....wine listings and food are not my style. maybe good for somebody else.,2
Too many advertisements for me.,2
"The Bon Appetit of today is certainly not the same as the Bon Appetit I loved 20 years ago. Scant articles, not a lot of recipes.",2
3 months before first issue arrives. Unexceptable,1
Basically a recipe magazine cookbook with pics.,1
Big disappointment.  There just wasn't much usable content.  Too many ad's.,2
"To many ads..
For the price.",3
Dissapointing,1
I don't think it is all that great. I seen better!,3
"I was expecting something a little different, but it was still informative. The franchise list could do a little more exposure and on the front pages.",3
Too many advertisements !,3
"I loved this magazine. The only thing is, I only got one issue! I was very disappointed in this terrible service. Will not buy again",1
Very good! The recipes are great! It makes me want to cook up a storm!,4
"The app itself is not bad, but I hate that I do not have access to prior issues.  If I do, where are the instructions?  No to mention the download is sssssllloooooooowwwww!!!",1
"Sure, the brown wrapper is gone and it's riddled with ads now, but it's still National Geographic.  The table next to your man chair is incomplete without it.",1
"I enjoy the articles in the magazine. There alot of cutting edge information and recipes in this magazine. Some of them however, may be a little much for me to try in the kitchen.",4
"I enjoy the magazine. However, theyt started out by dumping old issues to use up my subscription. I received three isues in one day. Yuk :-(",4
Received the first 3 issues in the mail at the same time. Will be interesting to see how the next issue come.,4
Some time it doesnt hold my interest,4
really boring articles,2
liked reading,4
"Took a couple of months to get but thats normal with all subscriptions.  I love the magazine, has great ideas and perfect layout but Just too many ads",3
I don't want this magazine anymore and am trying to switch or cancel but you won't let me.  Not happy!!!!!!,1
Magazine not what I expected to be.,2
Advertisements,2
Too many advertisements,3
The articles are so in depth and hard to put down!  Each issue has so many good items to read.,3
Good magazine but I did not like the idea of automatic renewal.,3
"The magazine was fine, but the format made the type too small to read. I do not want to continue my subscription.",3
Ordered this because price was so good.  Made me realize that I still hate Martha Stewart and her idiotic ideas.,1
It is Marta Stewart. I grew tired of the year suscription.,1
Too much ads,3
"This magazine was ordered on June 30th, my Son has not recieved it yet???????? So can not comment on a review at this time.",1
Too many ads but interesting articles.,3
Sometimes it's great -- other times it reads like someone's nephew was handed a juicy job. Worth it for the great moments.,4
wife like to read it,4
The pictures are pretty but I'm finished with my international travel in my life.,4
Too many advertisements in this magazine  and too few recipes and craft ideas.,3
The magazine has lost its WOW factor!!,1
Nothing really exciting,1
"Great Magazine, great price, arrives promptly.  Just a little disappointed as I've had 2 delivered so far and both times the front cover was torn!",4
"I ordered this subscription in December, and it is now February and I have not received any magazines.  I would not recommend ordering magazines from Amazon.",1
If I see one more ad for gear or picture of John Muir Wilderness I'm going to put the magazine down and go for a hike. So...success!,1
Did not like it.,1
It is not the information I was looking for.  I would like to cancel my subscription.,2
Too many commercial advertisements and not enough detailed stories,3
Might have just been this issue but was expecting more gear reviews,3
"Yes, it's a great magazine.",4
Not what i was hoping for.  Nothing really bad but does not meet my needs.,3
It said I would get magazine in the mail and through my amazon kindle.  I don't get it through my kindle.,1
I ordered this for my hubby I only received 1 issue on a 12 month subscription. What a waste.,1
"Well researched, but not very well written articles.",3
"I like the magazine but, cannot justify the price.",4
Hard to page through,3
"Great outdoors magazine. The articles can be a hit or miss, but the gear reviews are always on point.",4
"Too small to read opn my Kindle Fire! Too much advertising and I have not found the article i wanted to read
yet (Just Do This & Stop Aging)!",1
"Too many advertisements, not enough reading material. Very disappointed.",2
There are too many advertisements!,3
"Great magazine with really useful, informative articles!",4
Interesting but not enough gear mentioned in the magazine! It is a fun read though and worth the money! Hike away!,4
Very interesting information but too many ads. I had the trial month and discontinue the subscription. Maybe with less ads I'll think about it.,3
"Like all magazines its full of adds. The articles very basic and lack depth, the best parts of the magazines is the pictures.",4
Not sure if its because it was delivered online via Kindle but there were a lot of advertisements and it lacked good articles to read.,3
"I ordered three subscriptions from various sources via Amazon.  Two arrived immediately, two months later still waiting on Backpacker.  Seriously?",1
"Like the magazine and before my Kindle malfunctioned AGAIN... I liked this format.
Need more words?  One two three four!",3
As of May 17 I have yet to receive my first issue so I cannot recommend it. It is disapointing that it is taking so long to begin my subscription.,1
Worth getting.  Look forward each month for its arrival.  Learn new things about natural ways of feeling better every issue.,4
"I did not realize this is not a full-size magazine.  The small print is difficult to read, and doesn't seem to have much content per issue.",2
Received three magazines (past months) on one day - not what I was thinking when I ordered a one year subscription.,1
"I liked some of the health articles, but the issue I looked at recently had way too much of a Christian-type faith-based slant. Not for me; just give me the science, please.",3
"They were great, but need a smaller size.",3
"I have trouble reading the stories.  It simply isn't like holding and reading the magazine.  I would like to cancel the subscription, but can't find any info. on doing so.",1
One of my favorite magazines.  Also like to reference the calendar for things to do.  Like lots of local info and travel ideas.,4
I received like 5 bridal magazines the first month- haven't seen a new one in months.,1
Decent magazine for price.,3
Up to date information. Good product review.,4
About a month ago we order a subscription for J-14 magazine for my child. We have not received the magazine. I am starting to think we will never receive the magazine.,1
IT'S A GOOD LITTLE MAGAZINE. LOT'S OF INFORMATION IN IT.,4
"The headlines on the cover are not on the inside.  The cover gets you to buy the magazine, but does not deliver the goods.  I don't think I will renew this subscription in a year.",1
Too adult for 8 year old girls.  Should be called teen life,3
"Good content, lackluster format.",4
too much advertising too little information,2
THE MAGAZINE IS SMALLER AND LESS PAGES THAN I EXPECTED. MANY OF THE ARTICLES WERE REPEATED FROM EARLIER ISSUES. DIDN'T GIVE THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT I THOYGHT IT WOULD.,3
"What? What happens to the discs? Fifteen bucks without the disc, thirty bucks with the disc, you are offering only half of a magazine.",1
"The mag is pretty good, although I think they rate games too high. My real complaint is that the magazine is always late!",4
"You see, i feel that this is a very goiod bargain. The only thing thats bad is that there is no xbox cd that comes with it. But besides that, it's good.",3
When I ordered mag it did not state no disc.,1
"Short and sweet stories with gracious and godly
perspective. Descriptions by regular people of their sometimes mysterious encounters with angels.",4
It's all advertising with a few factoids about some coins.,2
Would love to give a review but it's been a month and I still have not received a single copy of coin world what's up with that?,1
"Love the magazine, but still have not received any!",3
I haven't received any issues.,1
Content is fun. The number of advertising pages is aggravating. Going to cancel.,3
Very basic very simple,4
The ads. Oh the ads.  Great price but gosh i remember when there was actual content.,3
Great and inexpensive ideas for the home.,4
Not much that I enjoy.  Won't renew.,3
"Does NOT include digital access!  This ""Print Only subscription"" for this GREAT magazine is not recommended.",1
"Got my first one - even the ""recommendations"" read like ads -  I didn't feel like it had much real content.",3
75% of this magazine is advertisements.,2
Expected more...,3
The just TOO TOO TOO MANY ADS IN MAGAZINES TODAY. CONTENT IS THIN AND UNINSPIRED,2
not much inside,2
ok magazine...but has lots and lots of ads!!!!,3
"I thought this magazine would have more of how to ride your horse.  This is mostly rodeo stuff.

I would really like to discontinue this magazine when time is up.",3
All ads. Hardly any articles.,1
A quick read then I pass it on.,3
There should be a requirement that this magazine have at least as much content as ads.,3
"Perhaps it's just me.  I liked it better when it first came out.
Too many ads.",3
"Not too much to review. She lives the magazine, so why not get her the subscription? Only reason it's not 5 stars is because it doesn't ship with apple pie.",1
"After years  - decades  - of following the TV show and subscribing, I stopped subscribing. I am very tired of their painting everything.  If it is old, paint it, or build it new.",1
This is a good issue. Unfortunately I can only read it on my Fire phone. I wish I knew how to send it to my iPad!,3
I got this magazine in the past and always enjoyed it. The lay out is odd now and the stories aren't interesting.,3
"As described, good read.",4
"over priced and geared towards a wealthier group than myself, would not order again.",1
Like this one too!!!!!,4
The only complaint I have is that it is not long enough. The kindle version is shorter.,3
Only got 1 issue so far and I like it so far.,3
Kindle version is difficult to read - couldn't make it go landscape - and so many ads!,1
"PEOPLE is three things, human interest stories, celebrity gossip and reviews (don't forget the crossword puzzle) For light news try PEOPLE.",4
"Good magazine but I have since then let my subscription expire.  It's pretty boring, and I prefer Sunset (I live in the West)",3
Just didn't fit my lifestyle.,1
I've only received a couple issues but I've enjoyed reading it although I haven't gleaned any valuable information that is useful so far.,4
"returned right away too difficult to viewpages hard to read and move from page to page,",2
Difficult to use; prefer paper copy.,2
This magazine is not for senior citizens. I do not plan to renew.,1
It was hard to figure out what I was getting.  Was it from Amazon or real simple. I'm still not sure what I bought our got.,3
I've never understood why a weekly subscription takes 6-8 weeks to get started. Just doesn't make sense.,1
"Great magazine to just sit and enjoy the articles and helpful hints! I have picked it up at the grocery store over the past few years,  I decided to just subscribe!",4
I used to like this magazine. It has really changed and not for the better. I have told friends not to buy it any more.,3
"My wife got this and I briefly thumbed through it. Not really thrilled, more orientated to the female audience. I can't speak for her, but she didn't renew her subscription.",3
I love the magazine but the subscription start was slow.  I ordered it on Oct 25th but just got my first one on Dec 10th,3
"I have not yet received one magazine yet.  Ordered Dec 1, 2009.  Other magazines ordered the same day have arrived.",1
"I ordered this before Christmas and although other subscriptions that were ordered at the same time have started delivery, I have not yet received a single issue.",1
This is an excellent source of entertainment and information for children with a sustaining interest in sports.  It has also exposed my son to other sports he hadn't considered.,4
My Grandson has requested this renewal for several years and continues to look forward to each issue,4
"I really love the magazine, but I have not received the first issue from my subscription yet.",1
"I like this magazine.  I think that some of the stuff they do wouldn't work on a small budget, but I like to see how they put things together then try to recreate it for cheaper.",4
"I purchased this a month ago and haven't yet received any copies.  Soooo, the only review I can give at this point is their shipping is slow.",1
Have only received one copy over a few months,1
Has a lot of short descriptions and a lot of items. The larger articles are pretty good. The magazine is not as good as smart money but they went out of business...,4
Not much info for me,2
"Magazine not as expected, way too many ads.  Advise is good but most is common sense.  Will not renew.",2
Needs more stock reports,3
"Didn't realize there was an automatic renewal involved in my initial subscription
 I Would like to cancel before it happens again next year",1
"I never received anything and now can't find a way to call anyone.....
My credit card was charged immediately and 2 months latter still no magazine, rip off",1
"No need for a subscription anymore--just read it online, often for the really far-out articles and horrific theology (or lack there of.)

A dangerous magazine for new Christians.",1
"This magazine should be titled ""Sailing boats"". It is all about sailboats and sailing equipment.",1
mostly ads,2
"this magazine used to be really good with lots of info, how to's and boat reviews. it is getting thinner and thinner. i wouldn't buy it anymore if not for my husband.",1
"This magazine is probably just right for some, but it is not my cup of tea.  I like Country and Victorian decorating.",3
Didnt much like the magazine.. Wish it was a different magazine,3
Excellent magazine with great ideas for home decorating and entertaining.,4
"I know it is that time of the year , I. Do.  not.care  for all. The holiday. Items",1
Magazines have become predominantly ads and fewer articles and photos. Disappointed and I cancelled subscription after free trial,1
Ordered this magazine to see what it was about.  Not sure right now if I would order it again.  Will have to think on it...,1
Not very traditional - unless you have a lot of money..  I wish there was a magazine that had decorating ideas for people with a down to earth budget.,2
"Pictures were fine, print was to small to read on my kindle.",3
"Be careful when viewing magazines online.  They started sending this to my address after I looked at it , but then bought a different cowboy magazine for a relative.",3
My only complaint is that I found way too many ads.  They should only use full page ads and add more content.,3
I only got 4 mags.,1
"Okay, but cancelled after one year. Took a very long time for the first issue to arrive.",3
Age range says it is for 8 year olds -12 year olds but really aimed at 12-year-olds. Cancelled subscription. Lots of ads too.,1
Probably a very good magazine but I misjudged the age group that it is targeting.  My 12 year old doesn't really find it helpful or engaging.,3
"Ordered this subscription July 31,2009 and as of September 12, 2009 she still has not received a magazine.",1
it is june ordered in April so until I get a magazine hey get only 2 stars for being slow,1
My grandson likes it a lot,3
first and last subscription. too pricy,1
"very very busy, hard ti find the interesting thing, to much of anything not a single theme to catch interest of a child for longer than a second",2
very thin on pages. not a lot to this magazine. I would recommend buying the original national Geographic. Not much material in this magazine.,2
My son likes this he doesn't love it. There are a fair amount of ads and it is hard for him to read alone.,3
My son seemed to enjoy this magazine.  Any magazine is doing good if it can keep his attention for more than 2 secs.,4
"From what i have found .. the editor needs more experience.

Having one's grandmother quilt does not make one an expert quilter",3
Not what I hoped for,2
I'm assuming our daughter must be enjoying this gift. It began arriving promptly and she seems to be using it.,3
After buying item was told would be 3 months before 1st issue.  I won't need it then.  Would never have bought it if I knew I had to wait 3 months,1
Not what I remember in my youth. The writing is not done very well.,2
"The stories are varied and well written.
No dislikes!
We don't know of anyone who would appreciate these stories as we do.",4
I've been getting this magazine for a number of years and do enjoy it.,4
"i used to enjoy reading the print version 50 years ago,  But i was bored with the stories I read in this current issue.",3
Fairly good reads.,4
I bought this for a Father's Day gift for my dad and he is enjoying it.  :),4
Not what I thought it was going to be doesn't have the info for the type of car I have in it.,3
Too bad there's so many advertisements within.  Probably won't order this particular magazine again as there are so many on the market to choose from.  Thanks.,2
I only received a few copies of this magazine.  What happened.,1
"I bought this for my brother in law, at his request, as part of his Christmas present. I did not request 1-year auto renewal and that is why I lowered the rating.",1
But it was sent to wrong address (mine) which bugged me and it could not or would not be fixed.,1
When my 10 year old Grandson received his first issue he sat down and went through it non stop.  He is still quoting it.,1
"Not as wonderful as I was hoping, but my nine year old says she likes it, and she does read it, so all is good!",3
The kids look forward to the mail!,4
"Somewhat interesting articles, adds are little overwhelming. Some ratings seem to be producer and/or distributor influenced.",3
"The magazine does not carry almost any educational articles, it just a big commercial magazine. big in advertising, including the articles that some ""FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPHER' write.",2
Interesting magazine but get repetitive.  Nice eye candy for the photo enthusiast.,4
I like the articles but there were to few and it is more like a catalog..,3
Mostly product advertising.,3
The fact that it was in black and white was a disappointment,1
Not that great,3
"Purchased this because my teenager is interested in photography as a potential career.  His observation was similar to mine,  ""It's all ads"".  Still the pictures are good.",4
"Great outdoor magazine, but too heavy on Canon for my taste!",3
Mostly ads - articles are far and few,3
"I subscribed it in March, 2012. Yet to receive first issue. what a waste!!! I do not have anything else to write.",1
Too much fantasy and not enough science fiction,2
"Sorry, but I'm kind of a hard Sci-Fi reader. This just didn't cut if for me. I will not subscribe.",1
Too many million$ houses advertised and not enough cottages and modest houses.  Articles mundane.,2
I thought it was supposed to come weekly but I have only gotten one issue.  Could you double check my subscription,1
"Too much advertising, not what I expected",2
"I love the New York Book Review.  I was downloading it to my HTC Flyer.  Now it is not compatible, only able to download on kindle device or kindle fire.  Not Fair!!!",1
"I subscribed for 1 subscription.  Great magazine that showcases New Mexico.  Did not renew, as I really don't have time to read it.",3
Editorial and picture standards are not what they used to be - but it is still a good magazine on a great state.,4
For years I used to buy Chatelaine over the conter.  I luv so many of the Canadian comfort food and holiday dishes and the articales that are in the magazine. I luv it,3
I subscribed to the magazine since we are going to spend time in Texas May 2013. Wanted information on local color and different places to visit. First issue was an okay start.,3
I am still waiting on my first edition of the magazine to arrive.  It has been 72 days since I ordered.,1
Not too many gift-giving patterns inside or unique patterns.,3
"Pottery Making has many good ideas and projects, especially for teachers of pottery and for children. The articles are clearly written and easy to understand. I enjoy reading it.",4
Somewhat disappointing!  Would like more Native arts featured.,2
I like the style of art and artists featured.  It is a must have magazine.  However there is too much advertising for the amount of actual editorial content featured.,4
"The articles are very good, once you wade through page upon page of advertising. Which begs the question: With ALL of the advertising, why is this magazine so expensive?",4
I love this magazine but only received 4 issues from my last subscription. How can I be sure this doesn't happen with my new subscription?,1
nothing special,1
Too much emphasis on writers and fans. Not enough written word. It's a fanzine. Yuck!,3
"Didn't like the magazine, not for me.  It had lots of advertising.",2
"My daughter is only 6 years old. It's a good magazine, but she's a bit young for it.",3
Magazine is quite nice just they can't get it to the correct address,3
not as great of a magazine as I thought it would be. thought it would have more things to make. pretty boring,3
I'm sure my nieces will enjoy this but I ordered it at Christmas and it is scheduled to arrive  mid March,3
i need to cancel this subscription. Please do it for me. I have been trying for an hour.  It is much too difficult.,1
I still prefer having the real magazine. It doesn't feel the same on my ebook.,3
Magazine is great...but the process to buy it seems to be a bit confusing due to the various options.,4
I was not fond of the format and articles were too brief for me.  I don't know if I would renew the subscription.,3
"The articles were good and they were interesting.  They were written
to a British audience, with a limited appeal for Americans.",4
In-depth features not found. I expected better from BBC. For instance: What were the alternatives to D-Day? Who or what  was really responsible for the victory at El Alimain?,2
many ideas,3
MAGIZINE IS NOT THE QUALITY I HAD HOPED FOR,3
I'm not sure how I ended up with this automatic renewal program. I feel the renewal rate is too high.,3
"wife is glad her subscription started again, i am glad of the price",4
"Use to love this magazine, but to many ads & silly articles",4
2 Stars  Like the magazine . Product not delivered as promised Ordered this magazine in September 2013 through Amazon with Express magazine only received one issue to date,1
It is a fine magazine. But I don't understand why I ordered it and paid for it April 30th and I am still waiting for the first issue to come (today is June 28th).,1
expected more,3
Wife likes it.,4
Fun to read,4
Magazine would not download,1
"Magazine is fine ,but be ware of company. Will charge and double charge you. Better off buying it from book store or some other supplier. Like the magazine though.",3
Print is too smal,3
Takes days to download.,1
Great magizine but I wish they were sent in some sort of packaging because The front and back is always messed up by the time I get it. Other than that it's great!,4
This is not the way I remember this magazine. Needs fewer ads and more self help info and/or articles. Boring,1
We don't want the auto renewal,1
"Took forever to receive my ""subscription."" It says a year, but I've only received 2 magazines so far. It's been months since I received another magazine.",1
"I love the magazine, but I would love to receive it before I see it on the news stands or at least the same day.",3
"The magazine order started late, and I only received 2 magazines. other than that, I love the magazine. Just wish i got all 6....",3
Didn't have a lot of what I wanted and I now have no need for magazines whatsoever. No point in waiting when I can just read what I need online.,1
Conservative magazine that fits my views.,1
A good Read,4
It would be much better if this was available for iPad it is to hard to read on the iPhone.,1
"I like the mag, but like Jon Stewart, I just wish it could be less liberal.",3
I found it difficult and distracting to read on the Kindle FireHD. Got lost in the content and gave up.,1
"Being a traditional quilter, the so called ""new pattern and design"" choices does not appeal to me.  Neither does the many small project suggestions.",2
Deal with real world business issues please. Not MBA school theory. Waste of money as there are better sources of onformation available le.,1
"Patience.... because unless you are a true Geek
it requires you to go through multiple copies
to find articles of value in applying
& appreciating the technology
it reports on.",4
The mag is filled with ads. The cars featured are not really interesting.  It is still a teenagers window to the world of could be.,2
"Full articles and adds. Guess I could do without the adds, but then it would not feel like a real magazine.",3
My husband says it's not as good articles as they used to.  I won't be renewing it for him.,3
"Not bad. a bit too thin, but not bad for the price.",3
Decent articles for a thin rag mag.,3
Arrived on time and as described,4
This was a good cycle magazine at one time.  Now it has way to many ads and little content.  There are better magazines out there.,3
"This magazine was advertised on Amazon.com in an e-mail to me for a price of $2.97, how come I paid double that ??",1
More worthless articles them good or helpful just a bunch of adds,1
I don't like all the coverage of black guns.,2
when i  was received this was to much wet with snow i did not complain for tha magazines. Thanks,1
Have it as a Christmas gift. He likes it.,4
a decent firearms magazine.,3
All adds. Where the hell are the articles?,1
I don't like the auto renew.,1
asexpected,1
My son enjoys reading about WWII history.,4
Seemed light on content and alot of ads,3
I look forward to Flying more than any other magazine I read.,4
Have had subscription for years and then found the price here was better than direct renewal.  Continues my subscription without missing an issue and no overlapping issues either,4
Great mag. Not very thick. Some good articles. Almost the same mag as the AOPA mag.,3
It's a month later and I still haven't received it.  Will there be any WWII vets left when it does arrive?,1
Picked this thinking it would have more general information.  Would be good if you are a pilot and have an airplane.,3
"Not as centric as some, and not as dogmatic in the article approach to firearms.

Did auto renew because I like it.",3
Too many ads!!!,2
"I received one issue but then the delivery stopped.  I would like to receive the remaining issues of my order,",1
"Unfortunately, I can't really review the magazine because I still haven't received it. The date they said it would arrive passed 2 wks ago.",1
"A reliable magazine to find good information, is also a good place to know what is avaliable. It is worth it.",4
costs less from the magazine,3
"The articles are all too short and it's not that informative, but the pictures are interesting...",3
not worth the money...My husband did not see any info in it that was different than the Original National Geographic.  That one is a great magazine.,1
I wasn't too crazy about these magazines. Just didn't keep my interest. too bad.,3
"1st issue was nothing but food,  i was really disappointed",1
not much I can relate to,3
National Geographic should provide the reader with more of the history and culture.,4
Have read this magazine for years - really enjoy it.,4
"Not sure who's reading my Readers Digest, but it's not me. Maybe the mailman is taking it to his house to read.  Needless to say I will not be renewing.",3
not worth the read,1
"The articles just aren't as interesting as they used to be.  Why would I care about the 20 best places to live in America?  I can't move there, so it's very boring.",2
Got this as a gift for my son's wife.  he likes it very much.,4
Just wasn't what I thought it would be.  Expecte it to be more Nat Geo style.,2
"Covers interesting places, but most are out of reach for the average income person and even most above average income families.",3
Disappointed in the content.,2
too heavy on joke pages and ads & not enough substance articles as there were 20-25 years ago.,2
"really after having some no shows, think i prefer magazines in there paper form, I like all the photos. thankyou",3
I didn't really want to read them. Daydreaming over the pictures was just enough..it's an ok mag. Just not my kinda thing.,3
"Lot of short stories on many topics. Not much I was interested in, so I downgraded my rating",3
"As a fan of National Geographic, I had high hopes for this magazine. There are a few interesting articles in each issue, but the reader is overwhelmed by ads.",4
"National Geographic Traveler is a great magazine for arm-chair travelers or for tips I can use when I travel. Places and prices are within reach, unlike some travel magazines.",4
I was disappointed about the contenance of this magazine. Did not find anything new or exiting. No practical information found.,1
I received  the first month then nothing after that,1
"After spending money to renew,  they cancel me saying I didn't pay for renewals  and increase the price, at this point they can KEEP there subscription ",1
"I could do without all of the sappy-tear-jerker stories, otherwise good.",4
where is the pictures?? and $3.99 for this? i bought a .99 book on here with 93 pages. thats way better than this. trust me do not buy it its a waste of money.,1
Enjoy stories and vocabulary challenge.,4
I ordered this subscription out of nostalgy for my late father. When I was a very young fellow I also used to read what I consider was a better version of this popular magazine.,1
Have a print such subscription but that doesn't seem to matter. A real bummer. Won't pay for a second subscription.,3
Not the quality of magazine it was years ago.,1
Solid magazine.,4
Good magazine for beadwork.,4
Please DO NOT RENEW MY SUBSCRIPTION.,3
The readers digest is great but the print is ultra small. I might have to put on reader glasses on other reader glasses just to read the print.,3
Man has this changed since I last subscribed! It's now filled with ads and few meaningful stories. Not at all like the Reader's Digest of old! Too many ads and not enough reading.,1
each issue has huge ad promotion for lawyers or doctors also gives dates of events that have passed useless information classifieds are always the same pretty boring!,1
We like the Magazine  But  we don't want the auto renewal,1
"This magazine might be good for children, but it is too rudimentary for an adult sports fan to enjoy. ESPN.com has better information.",3
I like espn so I buy this mag I didn't give it a 5 star because the mag is way to large ..,1
Physical quality of magazine is a great disappointment.,1
"Was a gift for a sports guy. Easy, cheap fun. Not always the same old articles you get elsewhere. He likes it of course.",4
awful thin!!,1
"I did not realize it was ""Auto- Renewal""  Watch your bank account for the following year.  They were nice and stopped the subscription.  I had 3 bought .",1
Too much advertising,3
"Content in the actual magazine sucks.  Worth the $5 I paid for insider access online, although ESPN could make it harder to consume or RSS, but I'm not sure how.",1
"MIXED FEELINGS, BUT ONLY HAVE RECEIVED  FOR 2 ISSUES.",1
Not as informative as I had hoped.,2
"As traditional sports fans, sons were a bit disappointed in coverage;  only have 2 issues so will wait and see: price was excellent, very fast delivery, no hidden charges",4
"The magazine is moderately useful if you are into photography, either as a photographer or just someone who appreciates looking at nice photos.",4
"Great magazine, have issues from the 50's............",4
not too exciting,3
Not very impressed with my first issue-will wait until the end of my subscription and let you know if it got any better.,1
Enjoy the articles,4
"It has changed format, and not for the best. It seems to be aimed more for readers that don't want to read and just skim superficial reports with cutsey graphics.",2
Would have loved it but on my kindle the print on most story's are very tiny and hard to read.,2
The orientation is wierd. You scroll up and down instead of left to right.,1
Not as good as it used to be.,3
Has some good stories in it.,4
Great as a gift for elderly relative.  Short pieces for quick reads.,4
My husband is a long time subscriber/reader - quality varies from month to month - reduced the number of issues recently - maybe it is 10/year.,4
It is wonderful but I don't have time to read it.,3
Not as good as it was years ago.  Plus they make it very hard to cancel.,3
It is good to read when you are exhausted and trying to sleep,4
i enjoyed this publication for years,4
I'm not sure I like the new format.  Perhaps in time I'll get used to it.,3
"I love Reader's Digest, but the magazine seems to get smaller and the advertisements get larger with every issue.",3
cancelled,1
very thin not like years ago,2
So much about icky illnesses!,2
not as informative as it used to be,3
Filled with lots of advertising. Wanted more articles on 9mm and hand guns.  Too many shotgun articles.  Won't order again.,3
"It was a news magazine. Now it is an editorial magazine,",1
too many advertisements. It was hard to find an article to read.,3
Cannot read well on google newsstand. Had to load to kindle,1
"Liberal Bias. As biased as Drudge, CNN, or Fox. Stay away if you want a truly unbiased read.",1
"Time magazine used to be the Gold Standard.  Now, it has been relegated to just another also-ran....",1
Not the mag it was 30 yrs ago.,1
Doesn't allow reading from different panes (both vertical and horizontal views). One is restricted to only vertical reading.,1
Lots of instant information and several extended articles. All very well written,4
I liked that readers digest has small articles that work well for the hospital waiting room I work at. Not as good as it used to be.,3
"Needed to renew my subscription and the auto renew was so easy.  No postage, no checks.",1
I like the longer articles that go into depth on subjects.  I'm not fond of the little snippets of info near the beginning of the issue.,3
"This magazine was always a terrific centrist magazine, but now articles are often to the right and occasionally to the left!",4
i bought this for a gift and the person was really happy. no complaints. good way to save some money too,4
To many ads and not enough substance.,2
Only 60% of content successfully downloaded to my Kindle Fire hd tablet! This is not acceptable for a e-subscription!,1
Typeface so small can't read many articles.,1
"Plenty of art work but effort should be spent on real ""news' not entertainment. Much better than issue about top 100",3
"just getting use to using the kindle and how to approach reading this mag.  great mag, this type of lengthy response is ridiculous",1
I thought I was ordering the kindle version of the readers digest....so I guess I have a confused review. Have not received digest yet.,1
Could not access old issues online. Please E-Mail how I can access the old issues online with a Kindle Fire HD 8.9,1
TIME MAG is great ... but ... I'd prefer a PDF version instead of this interactive one. Or have the choice.,3
"The magazine does not have much information. Taken out advertisement, you have just a few pages of news. Big disappointment. Waste of money.",1
"The color print in the magazine is nearly impossible to decipher. I cannot imagine there is any positive feedback about this . I say, enough cuteness, go back to black and white!",1
"Bought this as a gift for someone. The price was reasonable, though I  have seen it for less on Amazon.  Still, nice magazine.",4
"Time magazine, of course is great (on most topics) however Amazon's price beat dircet price offered by Time magazine.",4
"The subscription price was about 1/3 the ""retail"" price shown in the magazine!

The process was simple and the one-year subscription was used to extend my current one.

Thanks.",4
"Fewer pages, less substance, little real news, some entertainment news.  Just not worth it.",2
SOME ARTICLES ARE OUT DATED.. WHY IRAQ APPEARS IN EVERY ISSUE... SO BORING,2
My sixth grader likes it.  It is extremely ordinary and easy to outgrow.,4
I have it on a Kindle Fire and the print is very small. It's not for me!!,1
Underwhelmed with the magazine so far. Got an Ice fishing issue in April... Not real useful,1
some good science in there,3
There is a Lack of content and they only sent me two of the 12 issues! Buyer be ware!  There is really no valuable info in these magazines.,1
Good magazine.  Great price.  My husband travels a great deal and did not want to renew this subscription.  He wished it was more geared towards walleye fishing.,4
"Vacuous, disappointing quality of writing",1
Nice magazine but no consideration for not tested on animals products!,3
"So many ads. Superficial, unintelligent articles.",2
Didnt keep,3
"This magazine is VERY VERY big and consists of 90% ads. The articles are great, but the amount of ads makes it inmpossible to read.",2
Took long time to get first issue. When I received it it had a big rip down all the pages. But it was cheap in price. :-/,3
"l mostly flip through Elle these days as it doesn't really offer me much actually interesting substance. It's not bad, but it's annoyingly full of ads.",2
It has ads for things I can't afford. $2000 for shoes?  And plenty of Armani & D&G advertisements.  I will get something else when it expires,3
"this magazine is waste money, even though it was really cheap, when i purchased. but it was useless. all ads nothing can improved fashion value.",1
A few worthy a rticled but overall way too liberal.,3
Latest issue a disappointment as most of it is missing. I d/l it to three devices I have and it's the same on all three.,2
"Form of entertainment, not sure of what really true but great reading material",3
I don't like reading it online.,2
I thought I had paid for a years subscription and have only received one news copy.,1
Pretty photography.  But this type of magazine is just not my cup of tea.  I'm sure others will love it.,3
To many pictures.  Not enough articles,2
it came too earlycrossing withmy wife's subscription. Hers runs out in September. I will be getting double issues until then.,3
It's just a typical scandal sheet.  Only believe half of what you read and question the other half.,1
"was fine, i like the magazine. a like that you can read the articles as a document",3
"Come on, i use to enjoy your mag sooo much. Now its BIG pics, fashion & no info about the Stars, or pardon me, u do hav captions..why?",3
It's too expensive.  There is less content and more ads than ever before.  It seems there are even  less pages than before.,3
Good magazine but not the same as the one on the stands.,3
Purchased this fluffy junk for my wife. She sort of glanced at it. Not much content...lots of advertisments. Not worththe 5 bucks.,2
"90% of marketing of thing nobody will ever wear, I wish I could cancel it",1
I love this magazine but not the digital version.  The layout was too small to appreciate the fantastic layouts that I love with this magazine.  I'll stick to the paper version.,3
I do not like the new layout/format.,1
This is a good magazine for people who will believe anything. Do yourself a favor and move on.,4
This magazine is the boring version of Fast Company.,1
I bought this for my classroom library - kids did not like it.,1
I enjoyed the stories but was hoping for more focus around entrepreneurship and discussion around market trends.,3
good deal and a fun beach and pool read,4
Will not download. Crashes everytime I try to open it and can't figure out how to cancel subsciption before they charge me.,1
Entertaining,4
Not much to read here; tons of ads.  ( geared to 21 year olds with trust funds) I'd  never order it again!,1
If you like InStyle magazine paper edition it's the same on the Kindle. Great fashion articles and other interesting topics that wouldn't appear in a fashion magazine.,4
I had placed an order early January of this year and still am waiting anxiously to receive my first issue; it's already March!,1
"This offer beat what the magazine's publisher's best offer. If you like this magazine, why pay more than you have to? Good-o for Amazon!",4
I would be able to review this better if I actually receive the magazine!  Haven't seen it yet???!!!,1
Works on both seven inch and ten inch tablet (at least for my eyes). Quality of the content varies. Sometimes really great.,4
The volume I read basically mentioned only technology aspects which I didn't like. It's not of my interest. I thought it was more political.,2
the magazine content is good. however it does not download unless you have a fast connection. if you have 1.5 or 6 down forget it,1
Eh. Just fallow their Facebook page. It's the same articles but free.,3
Lots of fun and interesting information that you won't easily find elsewhere.,4
"Packed full of interesting, fun facts.  Only problem is that it is too packed full. But we will keep picking it up and learning new things.",4
"Ordered this for my father.  He loves Kiplinger, Bottom Line, USA Today and other publications.  He said this was a nice thought, but terrible.",3
"I had hopes for better content for my interest, its a good magazine just not for me and my interest.",2
"beyond not getting all my magazines like i was supposed to, the magazine itsself was very informative and interesting.",3
"Well, it is still printed, which is great but the writing has become a bit duller than usual.  I keep it beside the bed to help the lunesta work.",3
"I used to read Scientific American before they made it easier and for short attention spans, so this isn't the same.  However, it is fun to read.  Science lite.",3
"Covers broad range of topics on overview without equations.  More diverse range of topics needed.  Geosciences neglected, such as geochemistry, mining, oil exploration.",1
How can I rate this magazine if I have not receive it yet nor on my kindle as it states (print + Kindle),1
"If you want one sided biased reports that excludes much of what they preach, this is the magazine for you.",1
The magazine has turned into worthless garbage. It automatically renewed and when I discovered that fact I tried to cancel to no avail.,1
"Ordered NY Magazine 5 weeks ago.  Still haven't gotten my first issue.  Tick, tock.",1
"The design ideas in this magazine are not from today's modern Southern styles, but only seem to fit the Scarlett O'Hara genra.",3
Way too much advertising. Will not renew.,2
"Mostly beautiful ads, very little content.",2
They need more articles and pictures. Nice magazine. Good add more substance,3
This magazine had too many ads and not enough content.  I was not inspired and I thought it was pricy.,2
"A good magazine, well-made. I like that they focused both on the inside and outdoors of your home.
It's not that I hate antiques, but it's close. Too many in here for my taste.",4
"Don't think it is very informative, it has a lot about rheumatoid arthritis and I have osteoarthritis.
I won't subscribe to it.",3
Not a bad magazine for casual reading!,4
Judge judy's divorce and scandal was over 10 yrs ago. Pictures look fake and photoshopped. Not worth a read.,1
Fair not deep,3
"It Took Over 2 Months to Start my Subscription. But now that it's begun, it's a great magazine and always arrives before the date on the cover.",4
I have not received the magazine as yet I liked it when I saw it however,1
Not much real info. Too much crunch with little actual substance,2
"They have good articles from time to time, but absolutely no shame and no respect for their readers.",3
I only received one issue in 3+  months. Including the electronic version is a plus. the magazine itself was great.,4
First issue of my subscription arrived within 3 weeks of ordering online. Also liked the fact I could find a 6 month subscription for under $22. Very impressed!,4
Got the sub for $5. The best part was the swimsuit issue. Stop being a political rag and stick to the sports. I canceled my sub after CP got the award.,1
son has gathered these in his room and hasn't looked at one. Wont buy again,3
The magazine has gotten much smaller.,3
The writing is horrendous.  The bias is evident.  Not what it was when it was in its prime.,3
Price was right... $5. Print quality and paper quality leaves a lot to be desired.,4
Wow.  80% ads.,1
Articles have gotten worse over the years. Can toss half the articles due to boring writers.,1
"it was a gift to my brother, I know he enjoys the magazine a lot.",4
"Quality of writing has slipped badly. Should be an alternative to digital media, not a stylistic clone",1
"Not bad, but there are better articles out there in different magazines that I would personally rather spend my money on.
It does arrive on time and in good quality!",4
The issues come sporadically. I've missed several.,3
"don't like the fact that you have to ""undo"" automatic subscription renew.",1
"After subscribing for 30 years, I recently cancelled.  The too often focus on politically correct items, while becoming lite in the sports coverage, both became tiring.",2
sports illustrated has excellent sports coverage. better on the kindle versions.,4
I liked the older version better since I was able to access older copies much easier than with the new one.,3
I like it very much I got my first issue way before I was suppose to get it. I was surprised it came so early,3
I would like to write a review but the product has not shown up on my kindle. Where did you send it?,1
"Decent read, likely to renew.",3
"Not that great, not a lot of information or content.",2
"Same stuff, same products; over & over; not worth the money",1
"For those with country decorating in mind, for sure.",3
I always love country sampler magazine.  But it's getting to crafty and not enough Antiques.  May not purchase again till fall issue.,3
I still haven't received this item. I paid the subscription fees back in the middle of December and haven't even seen 1 copy. I do not recommend this product. Buyer beware.,1
Remember to go into your profile and UNclick the auto renewal after the purchase. Ain't worth it above that cost by the by~,1
"The reviews are objective.

The feature articles not as strong.

Hey, bring back the swimsuit issues!!",3
"Considering I ordered this back in February and it the end of march now and I still don't even have one issue, I am not happy.",1
Too thin. Too many adverts. Didn't learn much. Wasn't really interesting. Just read Suzuki.,2
NOT AGE APPROPRIATE FOR 13 yr old.,1
"Disappointed with this, it contains mostly advertisements on body building, very different from the original magazine!",2
"Not as good with new publisher... Magazine is shrinking in size :(  Still great informaiton, just less of it.",3
"I loved this magazine, but they recently went out of business. Don't subscribe. I heard they were still taking subscriptions but there will be no future magazines.",1
cheaper version of cooks illustrated magazine and has more down to earth meals with ingredients that I have in my kitchen,3
There are simply better country cookbooks available.  This one offers nothing new to a country cook with modest experience.,3
I am disappointed that the magazine comes so late by mail - almost one week from the time you can buy it in the supermarket.,2
This is an opinion magazine full of largely unreferenced wordy statements and conclusions.,1
"Easy to navigate, I enjoy way you can see the entire page but choose to zoom in on a specific article and then scroll to the next.",4
"I'm disappointed  that I can not view the Economist on my PC and phone, instead of just on the Kindle.",1
"I love the magazine, but it took months to get my first one.",4
"I used to love this publication, but over the years its leanings have become too evident. Shame as it was a great read for a world travelers or the globally curious.",4
"Pretty good. But it can be better, and there, in the new London offices, they know it.",3
Good but too rich for my blood.,3
It will be good if we are able to download audio edition,3
My neice and her husband really appreciated receiving this for Christmas.,4
Disappointed that the online subscription was not included,1
Magazine miss top notch. Problem is two copies are coming on this renewal.,1
"Five stars for the economist.  Minus a star for no digital access.

Beware: Subscribing through Amazon, you can't access theeconomist.com!",1
"Unfortunately, did not see that this offer does not include both paper and digital.",1
"The magazine has an obvious bias and agenda on many issues, and that becomes tiresome when one is simply looking for news.",3
"I bought it on August, but it still not send to me. Can you send me soon and I have homework about it!",1
"You get much more value out of an online subscription, I absolutely love the content, but currently the Kindle version is WAY overpriced for what you get.",3
This review is regarding the Economist on Kindle. Great magazine and format but the price on Kindle is too much to stomach.,3
the packaging of the mag is broad and the price is high. i typically read two articles per issue. pls think about four dollars per mo,3
"I agree with most of the other posts. This was one of the things I was most excited to get when I got my Kindle, but when I saw how much it cost I passed. Way too expensive!",3
I love the Economist in that it is so informative and relevant but this Kindle edition is way overpriced.,4
"Too expensive.  I just retired and I can not afford it any more.
V.S., Congers, NY",1
But the price is nuts! At least with the print version I can clip articles pass it along and take to my library when I am done.,3
Much like my fellow readers I must express my disdain for the excessive pricing of this digital offering.,4
Much too expensive. If the price does not come down during the two week trial Iwill just cancel.,2
Edited to look good on paper.  Probably edited by P.R. personal.  After the last nine years I don't see this as her words.,4
I didn't really like the magazine that much.  I found it full of advertisements.,2
It's changed...not what it once was.,3
Not my fav,2
I am tired of her political one sided garbage...it used to be a nice magazine but now not so much..,3
"Even though I enjoyed reading some of the stories, the article on letting go had no relevance on what was advertised in the cover page.",4
"I WAS SURPRISED, TO MUCH ADVERTISING, VERY LITTLE CONTENT FOR AN OPRAH MAG.......LOVE OPRAH STILL,BUT NOT MAGAZINE....",2
Disappointed in publication.  Will not subscribe again.,1
Love the magazine but wish I could receive it promptly every month.,4
It just seems like a lot of ads and not much else.  It seems I liked it better when I read it years ago.,3
Do not care for the writing of the articles. Very predictable and boring.,1
Wasn't all that great to me. Filled with what seemed tons of ads more than something to keep my attention,3
I like the magazine but I received three issues within 4 days.,3
It's all ads,2
"Love the magazine, but I thought this was a subscription yet I only receive one magazine.",3
crappy mag,1
This is actually a gift for my mother. I've never read an issue. She seems to like it though.,3
"Felt like it was mostly ads, sadly.",2
"I love Oprah, but the magazie seems to be mostly advertisements.  It's not as good as I was hoping",3
"DID not order this item ,please remove from my account. I do not want this or any other magazine from you.",1
"Though I love the content, its a lot of ads to filter through just to get to the content. Love the way kindle handles the pages!",4
"At first liked her magazine, but find each issue is always the same with the same commentators and same style. Will not renew.",3
"I usually enjoy this magazine, which is why I renewed, but the renewal process is not seamless, and I have not started getting the 2013 issues yet.",3
It's not that $18 is expensive its just that out of a 12 issues 4 maybe really awesome and the rest are so bad you can't believe it's O magazine.,2
It was alright. If you like Oprah. The magazine just reminded me why I don't watch her shows. Maybe I'm too young to get it. I just didn't find it relevant to me.,3
"Never got one issue- tried to cancel my order and it has been 5 months- nobody writes back
They take your money and never send!",1
I still have not received my first issue and it's been 2 months since I placed the order.,1
Ordered this mid december and it is now February 3rd and I still have not recieved my magazine.,1
"I bought this subscription for my wife and she enjoys the magazine, but so far each issue is delivered long after it is available in stores.",4
I have truly enjoyed the magazine from front cover to back page.  This magazine is very informative. It also has need to know information for all who read it.,4
"Now I know why Oprah has so much money! All the advertisements in her magazines! It is literally flooded, and it's hard to find the next article.",1
I like magazine..but I think would be better in paper form,3
Both as a gift but I think it is over priced for all that is in it.,3
"i have not receive my item yet so i really can't rate it

  thanks
  zion",1
The quality of this publication has suffered greatly over the years.  I subscribed for years but would not recommend it to anyone now.,3
too many insinuated swear words - I don't need that in a health / wellness magazine.  For example WTF is used often and other items - no thanks,1
"Good for those who want to learn more about health, exercises, and beauty.",4
Articles lack real content,1
Not many health articles.,3
"Better than most of the other women's fitness magazines, has more useful information and is less driven by advertisements in general",4
"I enjoyed reading the Health magazine, but I won't get it anymore because of the price. $5 a month is way too much.",3
Not sure if it's my iPad or the mag but does Not seem to be interactive like other magazines. There are play buttons but nothing happens when I push them...,2
This magazine provides good information on health issues and exercises tips. The only drawback is that there are a numerous amount of advertisements.,4
To much advertising. Not enough information. Will not renew.,2
I do not wish to get this on a monthly basics. Please cancel.,1
Mostly for weight control with diabetes. Good recipes,4
Too many ads very expensive for ordinary people,2
"I am sad it takes so long to send me my first issue-\

Sure it would be good if I was ever to get one?

Dave Tuman

New Bern , NC",1
Still waiting in the magazine to show up. Ordered two months ago and have only gotten an email about the online version on it.,1
Some good information,4
ads ads ads,1
There were not many good articles in here.,3
"mot for me, just coin prices, not to much about coins",3
It is probably most in depth monthly magazine on the market with good market price guides. Wish they had more categories of grades and more of current year pricing.,3
Great Mag.,4
This mag is great for those just getting into handloading and for veterans of reloading as well. Don't  know of any better mag.,4
"I can not rate the subscription yet, because I will not get it they say until June 2014. You would think they could get it out a little sooner then almost four months.",1
The format makes it hard to read. I had not read for several years and the articles are not as informative as in years past.,3
not what it used to be.,2
too many ad's,2
It's just a shell of what it used to be years ago.  Doesn't appear to be of much value now.,3
"Some gear comparisons; some nice pictures - overall it's not bad for the money ($5 per year).
Something to glance through while having your cup of coffee.",3
I renewed this subscription on 11/30/2013 and the magazine did not get the payment until the end of January 2014.  Two months is way too long.,1
Nice but not what I was looking for.,3
Compared to Arts and Crafts mag.  This is nothing.  Money better spent elsewhere if you want ideas for a craftsman style home,1
I was pretty excited to find this magazine online and wanted to subscribe until I read ALLOW 12-16 weeks for delivery.  Columbus could have delivered the magazine sooner.,1
I enjoy coastal living but which there was more editorial. Too much emphasis on photos rather than quality editorial content.,3
A lovely but 'skinny' magazine.  Would have wished for a more substantial one.  What it does provide however is interesting.,4
Too much advertisement,3
"A little more island living than Hamptons living, which is why I wanted it, but great ideas nonetheless.",3
Too many ads and not enough product content,2
"A LOT thinner than this magazine used to be, still just as many ads. Wondering if I could find just a much content, if not Moreno Pinterest.",2
Lots of advertisements,3
Tried to cancel,1
This magazine is one big ad.,1
"Beautiful magazine but I stopped my subscription because print copy is 10.00 yearly, and Kindle edition is 19.99! The difference is too much!",3
way too many ads and way too little information.,2
I only gave Coastal Living Magazine 4 stars because there are a few too many ads throughout the magazine but I will subscribe for at least one year.,3
"Works as inspiration for decorating, cooking, or as a dream get-away moment. I've kept all of my issues to enjoy when the winter snows come.",4
"Tried it to see what it had to offer.  I found it lacking, too many ads and not enough substance.  Did not renew my subscription.",2
"Subscribed to this magazine and after receiving many issues, I'm not the least bit impressed.  It's a very slim magazine with very little in it.",3
I ordered this on Sept 13.  Today is Oct 14.  Have not received the first issue yet.  I will submit a review after the first issue arrives,1
this is awesome if you have chickens or are thinking about getting them  great info you can really learn alot,4
Great diabetes info...but price is a bit much!,3
"I mean... it has some good recipies, but its pretty boring. I won't subscribe again :-( Id rather watch her show :-)",3
"I have only received one issue since October, but I'm assuming that's mostly due to the postal service. I love the magazine itself.",1
Was really disappointed in the amount and variety of recipes. This magazine used to be the best !,2
To Many adds!,3
"I gave it four stars only because I'm a vegan, and there aren't many meat free/dairy
free recipes.  However, I do enjoy the tips and the fact that it's chock full of
information.",4
is was very thin and not very many recipes.,2
"got it, its about eating badly and now just throw it away",1
So many ads not enough recipes.,2
Didn't care for this magazine. Just felt like it didn't have alot of good articles in it,2
"as with all magazines now, there are more ads than articles!",3
The recipes are tasty but a bit complicated for this novice cook!,3
It's a good magazine aside from to many pages of advertisements verses actual recipes.,4
Have always had an interest in archaeology and this way I can visit sites and vicariously enjoy them.,4
"I like it, and that's about all I can really say about it. It needs a little more flair personally, more pictures with color. Other than that I love the articles.",4
Nice ideas,4
"gf likes the mags, and not as many advertising inserts as family circle or some other magizines on the market",3
"its a good magazine, I just don't have all of the items and spices called for the recipes.. lol",3
Didn't care for the magazine.  Too many ingredients I don't normally have on hand.,2
I found quite a few recipe ideas that I will definitely try.  There was also more information on current topics that I found interesting.,4
"Same layout as paper copy, crisp pictures. The only thing I don't like is there are still the same amount of ads to flip through",3
Just wasn't too impressed with this months copy. Want to see what the next few months are like to see if I will renew next year.,3
Already used two recipes and I have only been subscribed for a week. So happy I don't have a stack of magazines lying around anymore.,1
Not sure what I think of this... I either did not order it or accidentally ordered it.  I have no use for this magazine and I certainly hope I am not charged monthly or annually.,1
Can I not get a free digital subscription if I am a current print subscriber?  Am I missing something here?,1
.I renewed Every Day because of an issue I read and liked.  When I received my subscription I found nothing to my taste.,1
Lots and lots of really practical recipes in here.  I began watching her show at the gym and got interested in the magazine.,4
"The issue has more information and ideas than you can absorb in a month, which is why I've gone with the hard copy rather than digital.",3
"I saw that I buy this item but I never receive this item on my Kindle. I don't like this kind of situation that's going, if you buy something you never receive it.",1
I like the magazine but found it was too hard to read a magazine on the kindle.  Don't like having to move around the page.,3
"Not many recipes my family would eat, but I love the format and it is a pretty magazine to look at,with some good ideas.",4
"the magazine's not what it used to be... probably not renewing ... so sorry PH, IDK what to say?  sorry",1
This magazine would be a lot better if it wasn't MOSTLY ads.,3
"This magazine is enjoyable and has a lot of research behind it, though somewhat repetitive because of the advertising factor.",4
Not as applicable to urban farming as I'd hoped.,2
"Some of the articles are pretty silly, and a lot of them do not apply to my location (Alaska), but this is magazine is put together well and has some interesting ideas.",3
"I ordered this for my husband for valentines day...It's now April...no magazine : ((
Not very happy at all..but will wait one more month before I ask for my money back.",1
This magazine is for the person interested in the big diesel machines out there on the road or in the field.,1
"Great Mag. Lots of informative articles, not too many ads, useful advice, awesome pictures, a wide variety of all makes and models.",4
OK. Magazine. If your rodding newcars. Still some of us rodding projects.,3
Informative magazine however there are too many advertisements. I wish it had more information then it actually does. It was truly a disappointment.,3
"The latest date that this was supposed to be shipped was SEP17 , I ordered this in July , where is the product , who knows .",1
"Love the new look and feel and size of the mag but the main point is to see beautiful ""nude"" women. That is gone and the magazine will undoubtedly crash.",3
No more nude. But good articles to read.,3
Liked the old format better! Won't be renewing,3
What happened to the nude women?,1
This isn't the Playboy that I use to read.,1
Most left-wing liberal rag ever published.,1
I like the subscription it's just I paid for it in February and my first issue was the April -_- . So it felt like forever to get my first issue,4
"Is exactly as I expected. I also get Penthouse magazine, but they seem to concentrate too much on the aroused vaginal entrance and costs a lot more.",3
Us Weekly cannot go a week without a Kardashian on the cover.  I am sick of hearing about this family.  I didn't renew my subscription.,1
"Trash, but interesting.  Lynne from Sellersville",4
It's just ok.,3
"It was okay, but I like a little more story to go with all the pictures.  I subscribe to PEOPLE and they have the same pictures, but lots more info about the stars etc.",3
"I guess I'm too old but this magazine was too ""Yuppie"" for me",1
US doesn't pack the lunch that people does -- too many ads and not enough pix and gossip.  I plan on cancelling this as soon as I can.,2
"Even though some of the stories may be exaggerated, I still enjoy reading about all the celebrity drama. :-) :-)",4
This is a good magazine but I had difficulty viewing it on my tablet.  I need to subscribe to the hard copy.,3
Magazine should definitely be less expensive for a tabloid in e-form....good to pass the time in a doctor's office or something though.,4
I had a bad case of the flu and needed something to read while ill that required no brain power.  This certainly filled the bill.,1
I am still waiting to receive the latest US Weekly issue on the kindle. Its on the newstands but not on my kindle,1
I've ordered the Us weekly for a 3-month period. I have missed 3 issues already with 2 months in. Not impressed with its delivery to Vancouver!,1
It is rediculous that an order placed on-line should take 4-6 weeks to be delivered.,1
Mostly ads. Not much to read.,2
"Its too racy. Im open mined, but I don't need 50 reviews in sex toys.",3
"Mostly advertisement, and bad advice.",2
I am little too old for this magazine,3
"I will never buy another cosmopolitan magazine again. I cancelled my subscription a while back and after their attack on Ivanka Trump, I am finished with this magazine.",1
wont be ordering again.  should come in a brown cover.,1
Needs more sex and less politics.,3
It's just not the same as reaping a real magazine. I read a lot of e-book and love them but I would never get another magazine online.,3
very good and thanks,4
Guilty pleasure!,1
Good publication.,4
"im rather disappointed at how bored I was reading this. I have thus, switched to Fitness (now bought by Shape) and love it!",1
good magazines,4
Difficult to navigate on kindle fire compared to other magazines.,1
"For the wife, she is the magazine freak here,as I prefer to use my time elsewhere.",3
Lies about birth control and abortion,1
It came on time. Not that interested in the articles.,1
Too many ad's and not enough articles. Many years ago when I read Cosmopolitan they had some informative articles I do not find this is the case any longer.,2
TOO YOUNG FOR ME,3
My fiance enjoyed reading the books.  And I than the Amazon team for great customer service..,4
"Crappy magazine, got the subscription for free.",1
Not the same as getting the physical copy in the stores.,2
"Mostly fluff articles, a few hidden gems . Overall it's just mindless entertainment. I've been reading it since I was a teenager.",4
"i use to get the catalogs to my house so when i purchase this copy i already had it n it made me upset. but i think i prefer the mags at home, it was nice though",3
"my daughter really like this magazine enjoys reading the articals and finding new trends and the great information ,we highley recomend it",4
"Some articles are targeted more for the single, bimbo chick.but there is a lot of single page stuff on beauty and I like the celebrity comparison hairstyles and stuff",3
First off you get it after it hits the news stands which is annyoing. Secondly why can't you just do a yearly subscription? Don't recommend at all,1
"I love Cosmo magazine, but I ordered it last month and I got a postcard saying I wouldn't get one until July. I am not very happy with that.",1
I do not like the fact this is going to be automaticly renewed to my credit card without a notice!!!!,1
Thanks so much.  You're very quick--I've already gotten my first copy in the mail and I'm reading it now.  I appreciate it:),4
"I ordered this magazine 11/28/09 and still have not received the magazine. what is the problem, do i need to cut down the trees myself????????????????",1
"This magazine isn't as good as I remember it. Actually, it sucks, and I wish I didn't have it coming to my house anymore.",3
Too many ads and not enough content. The content is just okay. High price. I will not renew.,3
Great magazine not worth $20 for one issue though.,3
It's been more than a month and i haven't even got October's issue but you sure billed me for it though.,3
Haven't seen anything of it yet. If I had know it would take so long I would have rather bought it from a news stand  or book store,1
I changed my mind and canceled this magazine order it wasn't due to ship for several weeks I couldv'e went to several book stores in all that time.,1
i have not recieved a copy yet am looking forward to see it when and i it finally shows up,1
Expensive for a cooking magazine,1
"I like some of the featured foods and the photos are mouthwatering, but probably not something I'm likely to prepare for my crew.",3
I use enjoy cooking therefore I enjoy the recepies in the magazine,4
Some recipes but way to many pages devoted to advertising! Wouldn't buy it again.,3
Articles are not that interesting,3
Half the magazine is ads,2
like the magazine but I keep getting billed by family circle,3
Very up-to-date information/ well written,4
Too many advertisements not enough content.,2
"I was very disappointed there weren't more recipes or articles in the magazine.  Also, I don't like the layout of the magazine as much as I did the layout in past issues.",2
It has not been in my Kindle yet....I ordered it but has not been listed in my Kindle 2?? Why not?,1
"i buy this book all the time at the store, so i thought i would give it a try, all it has in it is advertisements.",1
"The magazine is ok but I don't like the auto-renewal program.
I want to decide for myself not have it automatically billed to me.",3
I'd like to see it a little more interactive like other magazines other wise it is a good leisure read.,4
the subscription got all messed up 2 issues coming at a time; also the magazine isn't as good as I remembered.,2
I would not renew my subscription to Family Circle.  there are too many ads and not enough articles to interest me.,2
It's changed!  It's all advertisement.  It's horrible.  Found nothing worthwhile in my Dec. issue.  It and the coupons inside were already outdated.,1
"It's okay as far as magazines go. But, buy it at the newsstand instead of Kindle. You kinda miss the greatness of the magazine on Kindle.",3
"Honesty, I don't care for this magazine. Probably my bad. I expected a little more variety .But probably just my taste is different.",3
It's ok. Not what I expected.,3
Would like to cancel my subscription when it ends.  Really not to happy with the magazine,1
"Really not much in this magazine. Not my cup of tea. Good photos, though. Cancelled.",3
"Vacuous, though not as bad as People or Us.  Got it for my wife and she agrees a bit.  Will not be renewing.",3
Too much Kardashian coverage!,2
"I like the magazine, but I gave it only three stars because I read the magazine for entertainment news, not for policitical correct opinions which I do not agree with.",2
Will not renew.  TV Guide is better.,3
The magazine's ok - in the digital age I wonder how relevant it is. But for a synopsis it's a great weekly magazine that will give you some interesting stories and reviews.,3
I really enjoy this magazine. It keeps me up to date on all the entertainment news I need.,4
the subscription is great. I receive a paper copy but I luv having the mag on my kindle. you have more options.,3
"Love the magazine but hate the new format for the kindle. And why can't I see my library of issues?  I wasn't caught up, and now they're gone!",1
I've been a subscriber since the first issue over 25 years ago.  Enjoy the information on all areas of entertainment.,4
I liked the older version much better because it let you easily assess older copies much easier than this one,4
"Love this mag.  Snarky, funny, informative.  Less of a gossip, more of an entertainment mag. Will keep up my subscription.",4
There are weeks I don't get the weekly. It doesn't come on time like they say it is suppous too,1
I assume that this publication is enjoyed by my son who receives it as a gift from my husband and I every Christmas.,4
I wanted to read the story of Audrey Hepburn otherwise sadly People has become far to political as has almost every other publication out there.,1
Hard to read on kindle.  Get the paper format if uou want People.,1
"expensive, I thought there would be more to it",3
"If you're hoping for the low scuttlebutt on the rich and famous, get something else. This is not it.",1
I have subscribed previously; but the rising cost prohibited me from renewing in the past. This time I got a offer that fit my budget.,1
I love the coverage but I find there is too much style and makeup for me.,3
It is average news,3
Not much in people any more!,2
"Tried it, but nothing like it was a few years ago.  No articles RE anyone older than 30, so it's just for teenagers and young Hollywood types.  No substance.",1
Great tips on hunting the latest gossip and where to go. What kind of products for hunting people use and why.,4
"Disappointed. Thought I was buying the issue that was pictured, which I wanted, and got a different issue.",1
I love People magazine but I did not like the way it displayed on my Kindle.,2
I like the paper version better and the yearly price is ridiculous!,1
This magazine gives you a small peep into the lives of celebrities.,3
"Fun, good pictures and entertaining!!",4
"On the order of People Magazine, enjoy reading it.  Was offered free on my Kindle, and I'm glad I ordered it.",4
I expect eyes popping pictures but was disappointed due to low resolution pictures. I don't think I'll go pass beyond trial issue.,2
Good magazine but a bit pricey,4
I was bored and thought I'd buy a magazine.  I paid no attention to the price.  Not worth $4.99...not recommended,1
not as good as i thought it was gooing to be,3
I guess I expected more..,3
Trashy mag.  Good gossip read.,4
Magazine is good not sure how to do crosswords and no instructions given,1
HARD TO READ ON KINDLE FIRE,1
won't subscribe again,1
I like Ok Magazine.  It is easy to read since I get it online.,3
It was o.k. but to many pictures no interesting articles to read i don't know if i would order it again.,1
FUN and easy to read! I usually read Who magazine for some escapism but OK was at least as entertaining!!,4
"It's alright gossip for the price, but I wouldn't spend money on it regularly. This are fun for killing time.",3
"They should wrap these in plastic because the magazine isn't thick, so everytime my niece gets one it looks like beat up and the pages are torn etc.",3
Not a bad price for it.,3
As a photographer it is always a plus to check out the magazines for tips and tricks from the pro's. A+++,4
"This magazine just doesn't contain much photo content. I would have liked more issues and more content in each issue.
Generally speaking,  I was disappointed.",2
"Pretty decent magazine, good recipes and colorful covers. Also good articles.",4
Have already ordered this in another order.  Don't need any more.  Thanks.,1
All advertisement few articles.  Boating is my life but I want to be inform not just see pictures of products,3
"All ads, not too many articles. The colors are great and the ads are nice but I don't want to pay for the extremely small content in this magazine.",3
The Kindle format of BOATING is the same quality as the original print format.,1
Got for my DH & he loved it! Asked me to renew the subscription because he really enjoyed it.,4
Decent magazine with informative articles,4
Not enough content of food and other interesting articles for me.  I mainly went to the mag for Clinton Kellys info which was a short piece.  I probably would not subscribe,2
"Super Magazine for Homemakers!
Very good articles.  Excellent recipes. Lots of good tips and suggestions for decorating the home. Reasonably priced fashions",4
"I grew up reading Woman's Day and to this day enjoy all the articles, recipes, etc.  Good magazine and not too expensive.",4
"A great magazine with health, food, fashion, and other reading materials sold through Amazon for a fraction of the newsstand price.",4
I started reading this magazine a few days ago. I like it.,4
A lot of the articles I wasn't interested in.  It had a good write-up so I thought I'd check it out.,3
"The January issue might be the best yet, but Amazon have forgotten to send it to me so I cannot review it.",1
The magazine itself is great.  I got this as a gift for my mother.  It keeps coming to my house even though I've changed the shipping address.,4
"It has more ads than content, I think it is one of those magazines made for rich people, but I do not think they have the time nor the desire to read them...",3
not what i expected. mostly ads. no decorating ideas,2
Style is very traditional. I find Veranda present rooms more to my liking. If you can find it House and Home (Canadian) is wonderful.,3
"Elle Decor doesn't feel organic enough or accessible for those of us on a limited budget. Gorgeous pictures, but not applicable for the average design oriented ""Jane.""",2
"Magazine Title: ""Elle Decor""-
Good layout and good writing but my interest tends to the more modern. Example, ""Architect Digest"".",4
"great info on food, crafts, life stories, but a little on the skimpy side compared to other magazines. Clorful lay out and not as many as adds as i am used to seeing.",3
"Nothing I can't find online/Pinterest.  Only got one so far but wasn't wowed by it, glad I only paid 1.99 :)",1
"Not crazy about the TV guide. Disappointed that it does not list day time shows. It only lists shows from 7pm to 10:30!
I probably will not renew my subscription.",3
Disappointed that local channels for my specific location are not included and that programming from 12 AM to 12 midnight are not shown.,2
"Disappointed it is not a complete daily schedule. Couldn't figure out how to add to Kindle, bummer.",1
Only a few channels are listed in this TV Guide.,3
I like the cost of everything I purchased at vmazon and the products were all good.,4
wasted my money on this.,1
The program listings for the PBS channel to NOT coincide with our local PBS channel here in the Northwest. So it's a waste of money for us.,1
Not many recipes.,3
"received 1st copy fine, haven't received 2nd copy, the one showing here in the picture, not sure what happened?!",1
Good ideas in the first issue. I'm  impressed and anxious for future issues!,4
"Not quite what I had hoped for. Too many ads, and too many complicated recipes. Not for me.",3
"would like Money back, it has just evening schedule not thru day , we are retired.",1
Tooo many ads now.,2
Way too many advertisements and they don't show anything on until after 7 pm disappointing,1
Dislike not being able to dicontinue a subscription to tv guide magazine.,1
"few recipes, some nice pictures, a lot of advertisements.",3
"print almost unreadable on Kindle, and lack of a search seriously complicates finding the programs and channels I want.  I won't subscribe.  LSB",1
"Listing aren't always correct, especially for the second week.",4
i needed it,1
Been getting this magazine for probably 30 years. Enjoy the stories but sometimes the programming is wrong especially with PBS.,3
"TV Guide Magazine is great, except for one problem.  They do not have day time programs listed.  For the price they charge they should at least have their day time shows listed.",3
I have always enjoyed this magazine!,4
Quite disappointed because it doesn't have all the tv's listing and no morning guide.  Waste of money.,1
There is not any guide for daytime television and the evening guide does not cover every channel.,1
"Really enjoying this magazine
Great landscaping ideas ,decorating and recipes",4
Not as many recipes as expected.  The recipes were also not that time efficient either. Was also over priced for what you got.,3
Need less adds more information.,3
I love this magazine but shipments have been very sporadic lately. Not sure what's going on.,3
canceled my subsr. not at all what i wanted.,1
"only shows week day programs
canceled the subscription",1
Wish it was interactive. Small print hard to read,1
"Nice magazine, great photos, too many advertisements.",4
Good but cancelled because it is expensive,3
Not as fun as Southern Lady. Pushing a casual aesthetic... we were hoping for something more escapist and fancier.,3
Expensive but helpful,4
I have been waiting for my magazine to arrive in the mail. Just wondering why it is taking so long.,1
"I am a vegetarian and I like finding new recipes.  I like this magazine for that reason.  I really like the pictures, too.",4
I ordered a magazine in early NOvember and here it is December and I have not yet received a copy.,1
It is not that exciting,2
Great magazine with many ideas for those of us living in the southern states.,4
Not enough local items.,2
"There is no sports guide for the week, and no daytime shows-it only covers 7pm to 11 pm. Sad.",1
Convenient to renew.,4
Not what i was wanting.  Assumed there would be more recipes.,2
"Wish it had daytime as well, also the smaller size and spread out the schedule the way it was, easier to read",4
not a fan but my husband is,3
Like wish it had more channels.,3
"too much information that is not needed or wanted.  Trying to cancel, but can't find out how to cance.",3
not what I thought it would be,2
Okay miss the old style TV guide won't buy again,3
TV Guide is not the TV Guide of the past...there is hardly any program info...mostly advertisements and gossip..would never consider paying full price for it ever again!,1
I am disappointed that many of the programs listed in the TV guide are not actually shown as scheduled.,2
Wish listings were by channel numbers instead of channel names although I know this is impractical.,1
not a interesting as i thought it would be,1
It turns out I never have time to watch TV so this was a useless purchase for me. If you have time to watch TV and want to know what's on then this is the purchase or you!,1
"Not current show times.  Only shows from 7pm posted,  Not useful.  Not easy to use. Very disappointed.  Needs to more like old TV Guide.",1
"I was sent the guide for the East Coast, not West Coast. No 24 hour listings. Format is too incomplete.",3
This is pathetic. It is not easily readable. I am not impressed. It is easier to just flip the remote to see what is on.,1
"I like the magazine, but hate that the price doubled from last year. If it wasn't for that, it would have received 5 stars.",3
"The southern living magazine font is too small on a Kindle Fire 7"" and does not allow for zooming like other magazines allow.",1
"National and International News, old Classic Movies and Sports are mostly my interest, so I find TV Guide of limited value.",2
Love this magazine!  My mom is from the south and I grew up eating a lot of the good food highlighted in the magazine!  But now I have updated versions of the recipes to use!,4
I think it is good for the evening listings but it needs to have daytime listings everyday also. Other then that it is good.,3
Awful way to look at the magazine. Text doesn't enlarge as this app does not support this magazine. Buy only if you want to get frustrated,1
It's a good guide but I wish it had daytime also. I would really like more about sports. The listing for sports is really poor.,3
I wanted a TV guide for my mother that included the morning programs--this guide does not include that-this is why I was dissappointed.,1
"I had some trouble with ISSUE 1 but, now that  the publisher fixed the problem, I am very pleased.  I may cancel my printed copy SOON.",1
Mostly Ads.  Not a very interesting magazine.  I will not renew.,2
funny- great mag,4
Have only received one issue so far but like it. Lots of ads for cat products.,4
I still like it but was expecting a big fat magazine with lots of recipes and articles about the south and it is kind of puny.,3
Do not want to renew don't read that much called to cancel guess you didnot get the message don't want to renew Southern Living,1
I have yet to receive this magazine.  Others ordered at the same time have been received.  What's up?,1
"I ordered this magazine on August 23, 2009. Payment was made still have not received first issue. I have been ripped off. I want my money back. BEWARE of this publication.",1
"I ordered it and have paid for it but, it still has not come yet. I know it takes a while so I am waiting by the mail box.",1
"I like southern Living, but I haven't received the 1st issue yet. Please check and see when it will begin.
Thank You",1
Not happy with this magazine.  Trying to switch it with something else.  Don't want this anymore!,1
It is healthy eating and habits. Unfortunately sick want a subscription delivery but I don't see it on Amazon. I don't want a digital read.,1
Recipes are ok - A lot with obscure ingredients that you will have a hard time finding.,3
Too many ads.. not many recipies,2
Meh - I only found one or two recipes over the course of my year long subscription which peaked my taste buds interest. Beautiful photography and some useful hints/tips.,4
I have had a Year's subscription to this magazine and seldom use the recipes because they are lengthy and require a long shopping list of items we don't have on hand.,4
I have the first magazine and was a little disappointed in it.  Won't renew it,3
The recipes do not have normal everyday ingredients to make it easy to make.,3
not real common ingredients to cook with,1
The recipes require so many ingredients and they're not what the average person would eat.,3
"I got my first digital last week. I really like it, but I am waiting for the magazine to start.",3
Something is wrong. Will check it out.,1
"I can only do 3 stars as I haven't gotten the magazine yet.  I love it off the news stand, so I'm sure I'm going to be happy once it arrives.  thanks",1
"I love this magazine. The digital version for my Kindle was a bit trying, but finally figured it out. Great ideas.",4
I would have given it a really good review but only a few pages downloaded.,3
Great help in the kitchen lots of new and interesting ideas Combinations of things I wouldn't have thought of Using,4
I purchsed this item as a gift for my sister in law for Christmas. She was very excited to receive it and plans on making several of the recipies.,4
I like this magazine but I wish they didn't place so many adds for the purchase of purebred dogs. I wish more focus and information was based on rescue pets!,3
"Slate's content is fantastic, it's a shame they don't seem to be able to deliver it to my Kindle before 9am.",4
"Little to no interesting information, too many adds. Won't renew.",2
Meh. The articles were pretty lame.,2
We only received 1 magazine for a subscription.,1
Luv it. Great info. Saw it at my vet's office and wanted my own,4
Great articles and interesting stuff to read.  I enjoy this magazine.,4
"After purchasing on Amazon, the New Yorker sent me a direct mail to renew for $5 less than paid on this site.",1
"Since I got the magazine, I help with many ideas. And its just my first copy too =)",3
"This is a good picture book.  If you are only interested in looking at advertisements, this book is for you.  If you want to read any articles, look elsewere.",4
"I was excited about getting this.  But since January, I've only received one issue.  I'm kind of disappointed in that.",1
"too advanced/suggestive for pre-teen-11-12 yr old- clothes ok, articles not for young readers",3
"Do not like the digital format and too many advertisements. I was a big fan of the printed magazine, wish it had better formating.",2
"Overrated, too many ads. No reason to charge a subscription rate. Even the style sections should be rated as advertisements",1
"NOT WHAT IS USED TO BE.  MOSTLY FASHION ADS AND ARTICLES.  TRULY, A WASTE OF TIME.",1
too much advertising,2
"This mag is losing it high quality of yesteryear. Trying to keep up with the trends of stoopid young people is just that, a trend, not longevity.",1
"i renewed thinking it was extending my current issue, instead, i am getting duplicate issues. not happy with it.i probably will let my subscriptions  expire.",1
"For $5, it's hard to complain. I like most of the articles, but sometimes they tend to showcase expensive clothes/shoes that don't seem to be worth their price tag.",3
"This magazine is either good or bad,no in betweens. Each issue is different. Way to much advertisement. I have been reading Esquire for years. Worth the price for subscription.",3
Way too many ads.  Made it difficult to find articles.  Super heady cologne ads for men's fragrances stayed on hands and clothes.  Found one good article.,2
"Pretty interesting articles, and refreshing broad topics. Biggest complaint is lots of ad's, but then again its good for them as print magazines are struggling.",4
I was a little disappointed on how long it took for me to recieve my first issue. Now with another magazine that ordered at the same time Ive recieved 3 issues to your one,1
They omit various sections - no real rhyme or reason - just poor quality control,1
Too hard to read on a Kindle.,2
"Nice magazine, of course, but the view i can get through the kindle pprwhite is definitely bad. Not recommended for this kindle.",2
Isn't the same old Time. But still pretty good.,4
"Didn't seem to get wide range of topics in the news, and so will buy another publication to see if there is a difference,",3
It was a bad surprise to me to read Times. I did not find interesting the materials and brought to me nothing new.,1
I compared this to ipad app and the physical magazine. Clumsy app and I found it difficult to navigate through the articles and know where I was.,1
"On my Kindle Paperwhite, Time is not in color and there is not a complete edition of the magazine. I won't be paying for a subscription.",1
"Boring, too much long and after a few pages of reading- I got tired.
May be the next will be interesting.",3
Sometimes the squence of quotes is a bit confusing. And at times pictures are described but there is no pictures to view..,3
And this periodical is thin on content.  A half dozen items and that's it.  Now if I can just figure out how to cancel before the 14 days is up.,1
"Honestly, it would be ALOT better with the pics and graphs. All I have to say is: GET THE NOOK!",3
"The Kindle edition is much more expensive than the print edition....and does not have the charts, pictures etc. Hope TIME is rethinking soon.",3
There's too much emphasis on heavy metal in this magazine. It's boring.,2
Good  magazine,4
Too much metal and not enough acoustic articles and products.,2
I've been reading this for years and it is great. I really like the reviews and the hardware stuff.,4
This would have been a great purchase because of the cost. Just over a month now and I have yet to see an actual issue be delivered.,1
Reading format needs to be considered.,3
"Interesting articles and papers on a wide range of subject including those close to home e.g. Alzheimer's and Dementia.
I found the articles on climate change issues interesting.",4
"Very much enjoyed our first issue of Tea Time. Some great ideas for enjoying tea ourselves and
sharing a ""Tea party"" with some folks at the nursing home.",4
It wasn't for me.,2
Navigation is glitchy and some content appears to be missing in the current issue.,2
"Too many ads, magazine quite short.",3
"I ordered this magazine on Cyber Monday after Thanksgiving, and I still have not received and magazines yet. Where are they at? Today is Feb 1st 2010.",1
Grandson not interested in this cute book.,1
Much smaller than I imagined it would be. More of a pamphlet than a magazine. But my kids like the pictures.,4
it is so much smaller than I expected but the kids will like it I hope.,4
I would say its too small. It also often gets torn up in the mail and you really don't get very many magazines for the price you pay.,3
"Amazon thinks I have purchased this. Not so. I looked at it once, but the subscription price was unacceptable.",1
"From week to week, number of articles is very inconsistent. This should be an embarassment for a periodical with THE NATION's reputation.",2
had to load to my first kindle since it's not compatible with fire hd.....can't see the images and the text is disjointed....I will cancel,1
"I like that you can skip around articles while reading them.  It has been quite awhile since I read Readers Digest, glad to subscribe again.",4
Would have liked to have seen more Christmas stories.,3
I have enjoyed Reader's Digest for years.  I just recently tried it on my Kindle. I was unhappy with the typos in the Kindle version.,4
"I have always enjoyed Readers Digest. I was very satisfied with my Kindle addition. The articles have a variety of articles,which make even more interesting.",4
"......and it feels real on my tablet! I have been a subscriber for years, and this was quite new for me (transition from in-hand to online) but it has been worth the try.",4
"I do like the no add thing, but I find it a little cumbersome to navigate and find individual articles. If I can figure out how to cancel my trial subscription I will.",3
Took a long time to get setup...found a better offer 2 days later...couldn't cancel it so I paid twice as much. Not real happy...but is what it it. Magazine is cool.,3
"I renewed a subscription for someone on your ""renew site"" and now the magazine comes to me instead of the gift recipient.  Not good.",1
Ibwas looking for how to bead and this was not it.,1
"There's no a whole lot of content here.... some pretty pictures, but it just felt like there should have been more.",3
Magazine is not my cup of tea!,1
A few good articles on finding a job. Almost nothing really all that helpful in the money Dept. Seemed like a lot of whining about things that aren't silver plattered.,3
"I have not finished reading all the articles yet, but so far, I am pleased with what I am reading.",3
"what can i say, it's a motorcycle consumer new mad....good info",4
Lucky this was only $5 for a year.  This publication hasn't aged well.,3
My boyfriend enjoys reading this magazine. It was a good buy and gives an excellent insight on motorcycles and bikelife.,4
Husband doesn't like it so much. Too much news.,3
I thought that this magazine would be along the lines of Consumer Reports.  However it is more like a blog site than giving hard facts and info.  Will not renew.,2
"I subscribed ove a month ago and have heard nothing from them.
Don't know if I like it if I don't ever get a copy?",1
about the size of A NEWS PAPER ANY MORE,2
90% advertisements,1
"Would like to see more printing materials and less photos and add.
Also more info regarding  vintage  watches  and results  of rare watches auctioned",3
I like the ideas but 70% is advertisements. Just as bad as commercials.,3
not quite what I wanted,2
Lots of nice articles and tips on diy projects,4
By toddler accidentally bought this. Neat ideas though!,3
Not an interactive magazine which really is inexcusable art the point for kindle. Publication should be interactive like iPad versions,2
I used to buy print copy and didn't think I'd like copy on my kindle but the graphics are great.,3
"Not anything like I expected.  By the name, you'd think it was related to the DIY network, but nothing in the magazine was like any of the shows.  The name is very misleading.",2
discontinued,1
Disappointed with this magazine. I thought it contained coupons.,2
it is nice magazines for family or people who likes cooking and arts & crafts. Disappointed that each issue is having less coupons.,3
This time the magazine doesn't have as many coupons as before and that was the reason I subscribed to it. So I am not happy at all. Will definitely not renew the subscription.,2
Not what I excepted.,2
Very disappointed there aren't many coupons anymore.,2
Like the magazine but think it is way too expensive. Will not renew unless the price is cheaper.,3
"Cheesy articles, good coupons.",4
"I have hardly gotten any magazines maybe like 3 in six months that I have had the subscription the coupons are not worth it for me, there are none that I use.",1
This magazine has deteriorated this past year having decreased the number of  interesting articles and coupons and increased the amount of advertisement.,3
"The articles were boring and most of the coupons were not for things I would buy.  At 20 bucks, it is a waste of my money.",1
I do not wish to renew this magazine as it does not have the content I am looking for.please cancel subscription,1
"There is some nice articles and lovely photos in this magazine. Like many these days, this magazine has a glut of ads.",4
Ok. I hope furture issues get better. This way of life is dying out. Today even the horse is becoming obsolete.,3
I enjoy the Newsweek coverage on current events.,4
"A compilation of opinions,  Very wordy with not so many facts.",2
"Didn't really like the digital version, it was very short but not sweet.",2
"Unsubscribed after reading the first issue.  I want to read the news, not what someone tells me to think about the news.",1
The language is a little liberal and slanted. The photographs are well done and the double tap text is great for reading.,4
"hard to read on a kindle, does not autodownload new ones",1
"A waste of time to read this....the online version is sacchrine, and not worth the cost/time to buy it. Read it at the news stand; there is more in the printed vesion.",1
Only a short version of the printed copy. Try it  for yourself and then cancell if you need to. Cheers,1
"I'm a Newsweek fan however, the photography is blurry and detracts from the articles,  dumped this before they could send me another free one.",1
This is a fantastic magazine! But of course it is biased. And we moved and we missed out on like 3 issues even though we changed our address. Good to read though.,1
The very first time I saw the beauty of a timber framed home I knew I would someday want to live in one.  The magazine's articles and pictures just keep the dream alive.,4
"It has more ads than articles. For the subscription price, it is still worth buying.",4
this magazine I sent as gift and she liked it.,4
Too much adverting and little content,2
A lot of advertising pages fee real content ,2
I prefer magazines about self growth that don't have only perfect looking women.,3
not what I expected to many advertizements,2
"Changing formats is challenging and they succeed--just barely.  I had to enlarge every page to read them. Of course, there are too many ads, but that is just SOP",2
"This really is the perfect magazine for yoga, the only reason I have it 4 stars was because I didn't like all of the ads, I would prefer more content.",3
You gotta reallllly be into yoga and looking for seminars and weekends away - the magazine was useless except for 2 or 3 articles.  All advertisements.  I'm not renewing.,1
It was a good test subscription for the promotional price. The magazine contains a lot of advertisements. I wish it contains more and newer articles.,4
This mag is over my yoga-ability and way more serious about the true yoga spiritualism than I am comfortable with.,3
"Again, this was a gift and I have heard that the girls liked it a lot.  I have not
looked at it myself but I believe it must be good because these kids have
everything!",4
"dull read, not at all engaging for me who really likes the science stuff. might be good for someone but
I would not read it again",3
Needs more text. This is a bit too much like Popular Science...but without the pictures. Otherwise pretty good. Worth a look.,4
it was easy to download and read. The content was good. The variety of subjects was what i expected. thanks,4
Quality Magazine with lots of good ideas. Wish it had more easy to sew ideas or old clothes modification design ideas.,4
"I love Barron's, but not on kindle.",3
This version of Barrons didn't work well in the kindle. The printed version just doesn't work the same on the kindle,1
"Great magazine, but so frustrated that subscriptions start with an old issue.",3
"It's an acceptable magazine. There are some good recipes, but a lot of ads. I really prefer All Recipes,it has a better format.",3
Most of the recipes I would not make.,2
Too many damn recipes kind of boring,3
Love the magazine. Would like to get on kindle but the kindle reviews don't look supportive enough for me to drop the print subscription.,1
"My subscription was automatically renewed, when I asked for a refund, I was given part back and now have a balance on my account.  I wanted all of it refunded.",1
"Food Network Magazine.
So far I've received only the digital copy on my Kindle.  No printed copy.  I expected to see one quite a while ago.  Hope it shows up one of these days.",1
Just started a diet.  Would like to cancel this subscripton.,1
Easier to look on line -- just a bunch of recipes and ads.,4
Not up to par,1
Too many articles about cooking animals.,3
More recipes and less unrelated ads,3
"You keep sending me 2 copies a month--I had 1 subscription and when I renewed recently, I started getting 2 copies.  I like the magazine and the extra copy I give to the hospital.",4
Love it and like the low calorie options.,4
Had better expectations of this magazine.  There are way too many advertisements and not just enough reading to do.  Great pictures though!,3
"Great recipes and tips, but dammit Jim the ads have gotta go, lots of usable info. Get padt the ads and you've got it licked",4
Ordered this magazine for my daughter for Christmas. Always enjoyed this magazine when I would buy in  the store . Easy to order on line and have sent.,4
"If you like Chopped and other food network shows you will love this...........not all are fattening and a lot of great ideas for healthier and tastier vegetables, fish, salads",4
"I like the magazine but i am facing troubles with the delivery system, so far i didn't receive July 2010 issue!",1
"This magazine is heavy on advertising and ""fluff"" and very light on actual recipes. I much prefer Everyday Food Magazine.",3
"Lots of flashy pictures, mostly ads, you have to wade through MANY pages of full-page ads before you find anything useful.  Very sorry I subscribed.",2
I WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS MAGAZINE. WISH I'D BOUGHT IT OFF THE NEWS STAND FIRST.,1
Great if you have a device that can read it,4
"The magazine is great -- I'm just not sure why it costs so much to get just the Kindle version, when the tablet access + actual magazine is half the price.",2
The best  I am always torn. I love getting it electronically but often there is an article that I would like to keep so I wishing had a hard copy,3
"I found this very difficult to maneuver on the Kindle, plus it's missing graphics and the cartoon contest which I love. I would rather subscribe to the magazine.",2
"I love the New Yorker, but the Kindle version leaves much to be desired in terms of presentation and navigation.",4
A little too erudte for me.,3
My favorite place to read about books & it's not available on the Kindle Fire... I am heartbroken. I hope this is something that can be rectified soon!,1
i have ordered a trial of this magazine almost two months ago and still have not received a single copy,1
"i love animals and have had dog fancy before, too many advertisements, needs more info about dogs instead would be better",3
"ok but I did not get the full spectator so will not buy again,via kindle",3
Great recipes that work ....,4
This is regular sized.,3
Love it but haven't began receiving it yet.,3
"to big, very impersonal. wish we had subscribed to regular print version of Readers digest.",1
I have not received this magazine yet.  I ordered it June 17.  I can't believe it takes so long to start receiving it.,1
This is a good magazine. But if you have an Ipad they give you the print and e edition for 5.00 here its 2 dollars plus a month. That drags me,3
"Informative magazine, at $10 for subscription, it can't be beat.  Great photos, a few too many ads for my liking, but all in all a good magazine.",4
kid enjoy it.,4
I love the magazine.  But why is it going to take 4 months before delivery starts?,3
April is a long time to wait.subscription is a Christmas present for my 8 year old son,4
Of course Mad Magazine is a great subscription. But it took four months to get our first issue.,4
Its not like I remembered.,3
"i like the magazine, but can't figure out how to cancel the auto renew.",4
wish it was published monthly instead of bi-monthly plus it takes 3 months to get your first issue. Seems they could process your order quicker than that.,1
An OK magazine.  Mostly great pictures.,3
"While this magazine answers a lot of questions about ""clean eating"",  I'm not sure my family will go for it.  I will try.  Thank you.",3
Lots of advertisements. Can't print recipes from kindle. Lack of detailed nutritional information.,1
totally for super health addicts - not for my family,1
"It is not a newsmagazine,just not for me.",1
Not for me - didn't find anything new to cook -,1
Not what I was looking for.,2
I feel that there are too many ads and should be more articles and recipes. I do like the articles,3
I feel like I have been waiting years for this mag. I have been trying to eat healthy so I thought this would help still hasn't got here.,1
Seems like a long time but the subscription has not started...wondering if there is a problem. 4 more words required??,2
I would not order again but it's a nice mag,3
This magazine is chock full of lovely photos but I didn't find much inspiration or focus. I prefer antique-shabby chic-cottage-style.,3
Did not care for the stories and some of the paragraphs and punctuations were incorrect.  Just not my type of reading.,2
Goos i youhve eclectic tastes and lik to be surprised. It'd be nice if we ha magzine for more specific types of stories.,3
"An interesting concept--all sorts of stories.  Some are fun to read and some are strange, but I rather like the idea.",4
Transformation Magazine is nourishment for your soul. Connecting with kindred spirits and meditating on positive outcomes is a priority for me. Transformation bridges the gap.,4
"Of all the articles, there were maybe two or three articles that didn't talk metaphysics far above the average person.",3
i advice it because it is interesting to me snd my friends. Articles are too scientific sometime. thank you! i am from ukraine,4
I found it The Scientist a very interesting magazine to read. The contributors know what they are talking (writing!) about. I can recommend it.,4
i found the magazine interesting but need to see a lot of statistical ways of solving world problems using quantitative and qualitative data.,4
Magazine is not too bad. Got 1 year cheap prise.  The system renewed it without my permission,3
I do a lot of watercolor paintings. Like using the different horses as models. It's a great magazine to read,4
I don't remember this being full of advertising.,1
Too many advertisememts,2
Not the same as the real magazine. Very few pictures. Did not seem to have all the stories. Would not buy again.,2
"cute, but not a serious magazine. Like reader's digest about birds",3
Birds and Blooms has amazing pictures and interesting articles. I enjoy learning about how to attract birds and butterflies to my garden.,4
The rest of the magazine leaves a lot to be desired.  Not too much interesting stuff.  It is poorly written and not interesting.,2
Loved it.  It is so hard to find healthy recipes that are simple and quick,3
it's ok nothing that exciting i'd like to cancel it please.,3
AI have only gotten one copy so far but it does live up to its name the recipies are truely simple and tasty!!,4
I was disappointed with this magazine. It did not have many pages and the contents were not very interesting. No good recipes and mostly full of ads.,1
Don't like the changes since Reader's Digest bought them.  Too many ads - not enough articles.  Will not renew.,2
I had imagined it differently. Just a lot of ads for hearing aids and stuff like that.,3
Very nice magazine...,4
Enjoying this for many years now.,4
i just wish it didn't take 3 months to start getting them.. seems like that could be better somehow. thanks,1
"Magazine is great, but has too many advertisements and not enough stories.",3
Great price but price matter little if the magazine is not entertaining. I had high hopes being a novice farmer disappointing. Mother Earth a better choice.,3
Good magazine but it took several months to get the first issue.  They actually sent me renewal notice before we got the first issue.,3
Probably good for crochet people who do complicated patterns but not for me I'm a beginner,3
This is a magazine that gives facts and causes you to think. I read it cover to cover. I wish I could print up from my Kindle.,4
Some good articles between all of the glitz and advertisements.,3
"When I tried a sample of this magazine, I was hoping for photography and editing tips, but it turned out to be one giant ad. I will not be subscribing.",2
"This magazine is not helpful as far as giving you picture taking articles as much as it is advertising new cameras and equipment.
It is just not what I was hoping for.",2
Good magazine!!,4
I am not a vegetarian but I was interested in vegetable and salad recipes for the summer time. It did not interest me much.,3
I found it very sad. It was mostly ads for supplements and processed foods.. The recipes were uninspired and outdated.,2
I only wish I had read this magazine before I bought the app.  The recipes are not what I had hoped and are too complicated for the average cook.,3
I don't think I'm cut out to be a vegetarian!  I'm sure vegetarian's would like it alot.  Maybe the next issue will have some good vegetable dishes.,3
Very useful for daily studies.,4
Not what I was looking for,3
I use it every morning. The meditations give me something to ponder as I walk to work. It is helping me evaluate how I am living my life and helping me make better decisions.,4
Very unhappy.  Unable to transmit to my Kindle.  Your service agent's solution to the situation was to cancel the subscription and issue a refund.,1
I have been using this magazine for years. I especially like the meditations. The ebook version is easy  to use because the meditations follow the Mass readings.,4
"I Love this magazine. Very disappointed that I can't read it on my Kindle. So I, of course, won't be ordering it. I wonder if I cold read it on my computer.",1
My husband didn't enjoy it.,3
"Practical and technical tips for all ages.  Rated 3 star for several ads that should not appear
for young readers.",4
Nice patterns,3
Wasn't what I expected.  I receive this publication for free at my local independent bookstore. I plan on unsubscribing as soon as I can.,1
This did a good job of reviewing the books that were mentioned but it did not review as many books as I had hoped.  I will not be buying this again.,3
just got this recently so soon to tell you what I think over time but for now it is interesting and great photo shoots and fun  i like what i have seen so fard,4
"I have never been able to use with Kindle....
AFTER MANY MANY attempts.
This has never been all access at all.",1
Not for me.  Fashion ads and not much else!  I like more to my magazines.  Better stories.  More links and ideas on what to buy and where!,3
"This is my first magazine down load for my Kindle Fire HDX. It works great but I just prefer a magazine in paper form, which I am receiving as well!",4
Loved reading it in the nail parlor but the ads have changed. Not enough good deals. Used to have fabulous little inserts. Where are they? Disappointing clothes.,3
"There was information on amazon's wevsite that the subscription could be used with Next Issue app but that is not true. Otherwise, it worked with nook.",1
"Download is very, very slow compared to other e-subscriptions I have. The content is good, it just takes an hour to download.",3
I can't access the digital version at all which sucks because I am going on a flight soon and would love to be able to access it,1
Not worth the money not enough things on it better to just get another magazine . It seems like a lot of material but really not,2
Not coherent takes forever to get through and waste waste waste waste waste I rather have physical mag with me on my trips than digital,1
"Enjoyed the 6mo. promo digital run, but will cancel when done.",3
"I bought this believe in that I could view it on my android cell phone Samsung S4, but found out that it only worked on android tablets.",1
I like it better when I read a paper magazine. Last time I tried looking at the magazine from my ipad it just didn't work properly. I could not go past the index.,1
"Couldn't read it on my MacBook Air...how is it really ""all access""? Other than that, great magazine as always, but very limiting.",1
Long lead time for the orders. After few weeks time I am still waiting to get the first issue...,1
There seem to be too many adds but the articles are fantastic.,3
"Needs to be digital!
Amazing magazine, the only setback is that I cant read it on my kindle fire. There isn't even an option to request it for kindle.",1
This magazine is definitely not intended for working class folks. The designs and materials are quite extravagant. Makes me wonder who lives in these places.,1
"Lots of ads; not much substance at all in the body of the mag, especially when considering the cost of th mag",3
cant really score this  went to my daughter  she kept it so must be good,4
Subscriotion has yet to start after 8 weeks.,1
There is nothing you can get in these magazines that you can't get for free on Allrecipes.com,1
Pretty good recipes,4
This was not for me.,1
SAME AMOUNT OF JUNK ADS AS MOST OTHERS IN FIELD.,2
"It's good, most recipes you can get online now but price is good",4
I've always liked this magazine,4
Tried a few recipes and they turned out great!,4
All ads. Terrible !,1
"I'd rather search for recipes myself.  Also, as a visually-impaired person, I don't like reading magazines this way.  That's my opinion anyway.",3
"Not sure yet as I have the 4G Kindle and the file is too large to download, needs wifi and can't do wifi without help. Can't access 'mayday' without wifi.",1
Not a full sized magazine like it used to be.  Small 1/4 sized pamphlet.  Not worth the money.  I cancelled my subscription.,1
"I got this thinking it was the same old magazine I was use to, but it's filled with ads. Obtrusive and annoying and not what TOH use to be about.",3
Ordered this magazine for years the quality has greatly changed lots of ads now. would not renew,3
Too many adds and not enough recipes. Photographs of food are beautiful.,2
"I have enjoyed the special interest issues, so thought Id try a subscription.  They are not the same.",3
i only received 3 or 4 issues,1
Tried it for two years.  Rarely found recepees I could use or liked.,3
ive only gotten 2 issues so far,1
I think Taste of Home is a great magazine. It just didn't have the kind of recipes I was looking for.,3
Needs more receipes and less advertising.,3
"Some of the recipes are good,but this is not for an experienced cook,more like for beginners!!!!!!!!!!!",3
"Have only received two issues to date.  Use of non-familiar, unavailable in my area ingredients.",1
Has good and easy recipes,4
"Good magazine, thought it was a bit stingy to send the latest issue then the issue before as well. Seems rather cheap.",3
Not impressed!,1
Do not like the new format.  Was a previous subscriber and like the format of the older magazines better.  Recipes have not been that great in the past couple of issues.,3
"WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE ISSUES PER YEAR, DO NOT FEEL THAT MY MONEY IS WELL SPENT. INTERESTING TO READ.",3
"You get what you pay for ($5).  Several copies came about 3 months after I ordered.  Nothing since.  I have not went ""on-line"" to read whats on there.",1
"I love this magazine. I love that I can get both hard copy and digital copy.
I just do not like the automatic renewal.",2
"Handy to have both version,s but honestly one or the other would suffice. I haven't had a situation where I had one and used the same issue of the other.",3
"I cannot get this to work on my iPad, even though I have in the past. Conde Nast has the most confusing interface.",1
The content is often quite good. But the use of dark colored papers makes it difficult to read.,3
"To date, I'm still not sure this magazine is saying, so I canceled it.",1
"Problem is with the hard copy that is perfumed, causing allergic reaction.  I do not buy magazines with perfume inserts.",1
IT IS A WEIRD MAGAZINE TO READ... IT IS NOT SET UP LIKE A NORMAL MAGAZINE WITH EASY TO FIND ARTICLES BUT MORE OF SHORT DITTIES ON A LARGER VARIETY OF SUBJECTS...,3
"Wired is a quality magazine with great production standards. However, its hard to say it is any better than keeping up with your news online.",4
"Used to be a great magazine, not so much anymore.",3
Vanity Fair has interesting content if you can find it among the ads.  Amazon subscription services offer a nice discount--just hope it was not a teaser rate.,3
The magazines contents could be a less yuppie-focused.,3
"I have subscribed to Vanity Fair for many years, I have no complaints about the magazine. I just wish that i could increase the size of the font on my Samsung Galaxy  .",4
"Too much advertisement and not enough hard technology and innovations.  I was impressed by some articles and information, but was overwhelmed by the commercialization.",3
"The amount of interesting articles declined. I'd like to see articles on car technology, automation, control, drones, robots, kids teaching technology tools, etc",3
"The ratio of ads to content is disproportionate.  Although the ads are beautiful, I prefer the articles.  Maybe I am just envious of the beautiful models and gorgeous merchandise.",3
"But really, it's only the paper edition. We were disappointed and, obviously, we didn't renew our subscription.  That's too bad.",2
I liked the old Allure style much better.  These models not so attractive to look at.  Allure's articles on beauty products always very good.,4
Just not my thing.  I cancelled the subscription.,1
"Love the magazine, but don't like the app and got frustrated trying to figure out where to go and how to get it in less than 100 clicks.",4
I am 60 years old and this is not appropriate for me. It is more for a younger person. I would not be able to do any of the exercises .,1
Too much adverising. Backwoods Home magazine is way better.,2
Found it boring and opted out before I ponied up my nickel.,2
Spent to much time talking about how they changed themselves and how great the magazine is..... Reality really not that good. Cancelled subscription after 1st issue.,2
"Tech articles are decent, but how many clown bikes with silly 30"" front wheels can one look at.  Who actually thinks that fad looks cool?",3
My mom just received her first issue. A Christmas issue in January. That shouldn't count as an issue in my opinion of its old. Just my two cents.,3
Hard to find the content I hoped for in the forest of ads...,3
Too many ads in the magazine.,3
canceled it,1
The Kindle version was a lot better when I first subscribed...,3
Okay for the price - but I can't recover the 10. Amazon GC that came with it?!  Not too happy with this subscription.,3
I was hoping to read this more but frankly it doesn't hold my interest,3
"The magazines are great, but I never received the golf shoe bag that was supposed to accompany my subscription...",3
not worth the bargain and they end up charging you a higher rate.,1
"I love wired magazine, but I can't get the magazine on my tablet to save my life.",1
never got the messenger bag,1
It's just one long advertizement for clothes.  Not much by way of articles to read.,2
"Great mag, terrible hat. I had this cheap hat for about 5 minutes before I chucked it into the garbage.",1
"Good magazine, arrived quickly- but no free messenger bag.",4
Never received the messenger bag ordered with the subscription,1
"OMG, the electronic version is like a huge advertisement vehicle with some stories.  The writing and stories are very interesting.",4
Cheap Hat.,1
"I get the monthly publication, but no access to digital style guide or gift card. I called and GQ wasn't sure as to when I would get access to those items. Just told me to wait",1
Will not renew. Prefer the print edition. Cannot find what I'm looking for. If you don't like ads then this is for you.,1
Everything is way out of my price range,3
Not as good as it was in the past & still no scarf but it had some decent articles.,3
Bag is smaller than picture leads one to believe; plastic coated canvas with small opening. I like having the magazine on my Kindle,4
Got my free scarf but the app never downloaded into my kindle.,1
The bag is awful. The magazine is wonderful. The articles and photography are first rate. The bag is an awful shape and awkward to use. A tote would have been better.,1
Although I haven't received the actual magazine I have enjoyed reading the digital version. A good way to carry around the magazine's.,3
"Loved having it on my tablet and not collecting dust on shelf...but some pages never load, no matter how long I wait.  :-/",4
Love my GlamourMag but ordering from Amazon was a pain!,3
Never got my tote.,1
I've never received any print issue.,1
Got the bag no magazine though,1
It's like some cheap free gift. Whatever.,3
Worst free gift ever - went in the trash! About half the size it seems and made of a cheap shiny poly-plastic. Disappointing for a magazine that should know better,1
Already being bothered to renew and never got the tote.,1
I like the magazine but have not received the tote yet.,3
didn't get my free bag.,1
I really like the magazine. The convenience of having it on my kindle was great. Really enjoyed the articles.  I would recommend magazine to others. Never received the free tote.,4
"i gave only 1 star as I haven't received the tote and pouch, magazine is fine",3
I didn't get a tote bag. But I enjoy glamour magazine,3
Alot of ads in.magazine,2
There is nothing I can say.... I am not able to down laud the magazine on my kindle fire.  I am waiting in september for my fist magazine.  i ordered in June 22.  a month before.,1
"and it works just fine but what a colossal waste to send me the print version. I don't need both versions, and I probably won't renew my subscription.",1
Clutch was VERY cheap and of poor quality! Shame on Conde Nast!,1
Love Vogue; loyal subscriber for years. Did not receive the the free clutch though!,4
Never received the free clutch from this promotion. VOGUE is still a good magazine.,1
"The magazine is great, but I never received the promised free clutch which I had planned to give to my daughter.",3
"cannot access  it on line, got first paper magazine,  disappointed, it's not what VOGUE used to be, but a think you get what you pay!!!",1
She always has great tasting recipes just love paula wish she would come back to tv,4
boring magazine,2
Articles are kind meh; I wouldn't buy this again.,3
Not of much interest to me now that I am retired,3
Over hyped. No big insights or innovative concepts.,1
printing is too small.,2
"money

Never received printed version of magazine, no tote bag either. Electronic version wouldn't allow me to download with out paying again. Don't waste your money.",1
I love the magazine however I hate that I have to wait almost 2 weeks after it shows up in the store to receive my copy.,1
too many ADS!,3
"I received the ""tote"" bag but no magazine.  Seems weird to me as normally I get the magazine but not the free gift......",1
not my favorite magazine but there are a few things I enjoy.,4
"The magazine subscription seems to have renewed, but I have not yet received the free tote bag",1
"Love the magazines, but i never received the tote bag. :(",3
Great that the digital download is quick. Still have not gotten the magazine or the tote and it's been a couple months.,4
I got the tote bag but not the magazine.,3
Good magazine but no tote bag.,3
Still awaiting for my paper copy,1
Packed with adds. Nothing interesting to read.,3
"All ads, very little content. I would say about 85% of it is advertising. Was also supposed to receive a clutch, but that never came through.",2
"Too many advertisements, and the stuff advertised is way too expensive. $1500 for a skirt?! This magazine lacks content.",2
Kinda boring.,2
Have not recieved the free gym bag or the magazin,1
Haven't gotten the bag... sooooo whats up with that? Magazine is ok...,3
I don't like the fact that I paid for it and it will not start until July.  I am very disappointed.,1
Wasn't what I expected.  Much more stories than recipes.  A lot of the recipes are very complex using ingredients I've never even heard of.  I prefer a bit more simple cooking.,2
"Have been receiving the HGTV magazine fir a couple of years. Really enjoy the pictures, articles, and the comparison product pages.",4
"Informative, colorful and a great read.",4
It's good to read,4
Love Dr. Oz magazine....but have not tried the digital as of yet....,3
Still has a lot of process food options - would like more non-process - organic ideas.,3
they keep cutting my sub. off.,1
"I ordered this almost two months ago and never received a print copy.
However, the digital copy is good quality.",1
"Came in weird order...wasn't chronological starting off with February, then January.",1
Only a few articles in each issue that interest me.  The furniture make-overs are my favorite.,4
could not get this to downlosd,1
Ingredients to expensive and hard to find where I live.,3
I would not order again.  Do not renew.,1
"I was never able to access the magazine electronically, but did (and do) receive my print edition.",1
I still have not received a copy on my Kindle.,1
too many recipes,3
Digital Popular Mechanics not really cutting it,1
"Purchased online and paper. Great magazine, by have not yet received a magazine?! Maybe it had not been published yet? Will update review when received.",1
"I love this magazine.  Mostly positive, good stories about stars.  There is some television stuff
in it as well as crossword puzzles and such.  Really enjoy the read.",4
Good magazine on handguns.,4
"I have not received the Kindle edition, only the print edition",1
not like yesteryear! Readable with not much meat in it.,2
Full of ads like all magazines any more,2
First issue just ok. Looking forward to next.,4
Too many times they refer you to the website to get a recipe or additional news.  Why buy the magazine if they do that?,1
Good magazine. Lots of healthy eating ideas.,4
"No, not really good.  No organization, jus a print of their online recipes - there's been no additional testing or tasting.  Not renewing.",1
It wasn't like I remembered it.,3
very informative great for women over 35,4
Kindle version no longer available,1
I like this Mag!,4
love the magazine but subscribing was a hassle - thanks to Amazon for their help,4
too many advertisements in this magazine.,2
"Not fancy for me, but price was right. Lots of ads but have found a few recipes to try",3
Too many ads.  Cant tell ads from the recipes.,3
This has gone from a serious cooking magazine to a fluff piece full of ads. I will not renew.,1
LOTS  of advertisements - I wanted to see more pictures of rooms transformed as in before and after and the steps along the way.,3
Great magazine!  Will be  very useful.,4
Still a good mag. Petzal is great. But it seems like it's mostly an advertisement for overpriced gear.,3
Ordered in March and have yet to see a single issue.,1
No directions on how to access the digital version. Maybe I'll figure it out.,1
Excellent research and easy to read. Very interesting topics,4
wont re-order,1
"Lots of good tips, worth the subscription",4
This magazine went down in quality.,1
More advertising then I would like.,3
"Same every month. Ok for muscle heads. If you aren't one, pass.",3
"The magazine is good, however I can't seem to access the digital version. I'm a bit confused about that I've never had any problems with past subscriptions",3
So sorry there seem to be more ads than articles. Tried to cancel the subcription but was not successful.,1
It's good mag possibly  not in their target market,3
Not much information on plane and ship,3
It's a pretty good magazine.  And I am happy I'm getting to try it for free.,4
Too many advertisements not enough articles on do it yourself repairs,2
Not enough DIY projects to rate higher.,2
"Not much content, I find it comes with mostly ads in the magazine.",2
This use to be a better magazine when it was a complication,2
Strictly for the PROFESSIONAL.,3
"Decent magazine, but shady ""Free Gifts"" that never come practice.",3
Nkit what I thought. More for racing or touring.,3
Never got the free tote or special edition issue.,1
Just not to my taste.,2
Haven't read this magazine in years.  It's a bit skinnier on ideas and size.,3
I miss the good old days when Oprah was relevant.,4
Did not renew one word BORING,1
It was okay. If the price is low I will subscribe. It's nice reading it off my phone. I always have something to read waiting for appointments.,4
Enjoy Vogue very much,4
Good tips and great plans,4
Boring magazine,1
90% ads . . . I wanted something that would help me in my career.  This ain't it,1
No recipes I wanted in the first issue,1
Just another magazine with tons of advertising and very little information.,2
It took a while for the first issue to come and it much smaller than I expected.,3
I am really not crazy about this magazine.  I don't like the format.  It is too hard to read.,2
This magazine is a Christmas present to a relative.  He enjoys it very much.  I have had issues with the publishers about duplicates but that seems to have been straightened out.,4
"i have had this magazine before and its great, only problem is i don't get my first issue until july. thats sad.",3
This magazine has really gone downhill. It's sooooo thin there's almost no point in reading it....it's all advertisements,2
"I really only started reading this, but it is good so far.",4
Used to be a great mag. Now the city has changed a lot and I am not as interested in it as during the good old days.,3
GREAT MAG,4
"I decided to get a subscription after not reading it for several years. Definitely not the Men's Health I remember, just page after page of advertising.",1
I liked the Art News of the 60s through the 90s. I am considering dropping my subscription to this magazine. Art Educator and artist.,4
"Badly written articles lack chain of evidence, lack even an overview of counter arguments, show no supporting reasoning.",1
Magazine can be boring.,1
Boring. Will not be renewing.,2
"Well-written, great design, great photography...",4
I do find some good articles in the Atlanta magazine from time to time.  I have enjoyed reading it.,4
gets less interesting every year!,3
Not a fan,1
Very poor print quality.,1
Decent magazine at a great price.,4
It said I would be getting 8 issues. I got 4. Do not subscribe to this. Its not worth it.,1
It's better than most. lol.,3
"Remember the old Glamour magazine that used to have such great articles with some ads here and there? this is not it!
 this is all ads targeted to young women.",2
SO many advertisements.,2
A go-to magazine for the modern metrosexual,4
"Some good articles but that's about it.
Smells strongly of several colognes all at once.",3
really not impressed with it.,1
"Probably is a good stuff for people who knows the art of crochet; but , it did not feel the expectations of my wife. For entertaiment of beginners is not a good guide.",3
I have had other issues of this magazine before so I know I will like it once it starts to come.,4
Mostly ads,3
My son really enjoys this. Thank you.,4
Barely has any content. Amount of advertisement close to the stuff being dropped to the mailbox for free.,1
Not what it was years ago.,2
interesting - I like it,4
Hard to find any articles in here -- it's all advertisements!,2
"Not great, more for the beginning investor.  I will not renew my subscription",3
Tried it out with a deal of the day. Very thin 'magazine' not a lot of anything remarkable. Articles are short.,2
"I agree with the others that say it isn't worth the ink it's printed on. I subscribes years ago, but when they changed the magazine it became crap.",1
"I say this about most of my current paper prescripts, this one is better online than in hard copy.  Too many ads to get to substance.",3
The paper this is printed on his practically see-through. I don't even think it would work for clip crafts. And most of the information is available on the internet.,3
"You need to pay attention to the date that is says they will start delivering. I bought this as a gift, but it's one that won't start giving until MONTHS later.",1
Love the magazine but do not feel I received best price,3
"Not a bad publication, but it really is mostly ads. Some insightful articles and the industry focus editions can be interesting, but for the most part, not worth it.",3
"This is being advertised and sold as a print/digital bundle, but it's actually just the print version.",2
Filled with ads and sneaky product placement! The stories are weak and  too many pointless crafts that you could easily look up on Pinterest. Firefly is so so much better.,2
"it should be renamed national people magazine, it used to be about far away and exotic places, now it about people instead like Picasso ,in this months magazine",1
Ok I guess. A little too liberal for my liking...,3
This is a great magazine for quick reading and great pictures.  I prefer the layout of People but this is a much more affordable magazine.,3
Felt far too many ads,2
Reasonably informative but could/should be a lot better. Style and content not up to date; related website totally useless even for magazine subscribers.,1
Mostly ads I'm not interested in,2
"I am on my second issue, not finding , the kind of information I was expecting, but I remain hopeful.",3
"I subscribed for 1 year, but my second issue was not delivered. Received 3rd issue, but disappointed to miss an issue when I paid for a year.",1
"We got two issues and haven't seen any since. For the price it wasn't a complete waste, but the little one was disappointed.",1
I bought it because I thought there would be more images inside - visual inspiration for the home. But it was all text and recipes.,3
"Not much new content and rehashes the old material under new titles, just read online sites and you will be informed",1
"Definitely not what I was expecting.  Very abstract and at times pornographic.  I deleted it almost as soon as it was downloaded.  NOT for me, for sure!",2
"3 stars for price.  The content is excellent, but you don't need it.  Buy only if you are featured in it =-)",4
Was ok but nothing special. Have had much much better mags over the years.,3
This is definitely a magazine for a younger reader.,4
Digital copy is difficult to get,3
cancelled it because it doesn't have articles I can use.,1
I used to really love this magazine.  It's been dumb downed and I am not a fan.,1
Received in great condition!,4
"I wanted to like this magazine but it was full of ads. I'm sure times are tough, but I don't feel the need to weed through the ads.",3
I found this mag a bit over my head and very technical. Although I WAS able to get some things out of it from reading the issues received.,3
Son enjoyed the magazine.,4
"i need, i saw, i buy, i could of lots done better

VERY EXPENSIVE",1
Don't waste your money on this magazine. The photos are nice but this magazine is way over priced. You can find the same information online.,1
"Nice glossy magazine for the millionares out there.  If you are poor like me, forget this one or you will regret it.",4
Was a little infantile for a 9-10 year old.,3
This magazine is mostly ad's.,2
The publication usually has an article or two worth reading but for the most part is filled with advertisements. Cancelled my subscription before the year was out.,2
"I love the magazine, but it doesn't deliver on time!",3
Overpriced these days for a thin magazine .Few articles of interest IMHO to the average owner..,1
Disappointed. I thought it was supposed to be a magazine.,1
Thought it would be a quality magazine. Turns out to be a few page pamphlet. Definitely not worth the money.,1
Not to bad!,3
"There few articles.  The magazine is mostly ads and classifieds, which isn't what I was looking for.",2
"Being a ""Gun Nut"" from my early youth I find this magazine has always fulfilled my need to be up-to-date on all things guns.",4
"The magazine has lost a lot over the years, but it still have an occasional good article on the hobby.",4
The magazine seemed light on information.  I researched and found I could access the same type of information online for free.,1
"Fine Magazine, too bad I get two every month.",3
come 2-3 month late after order and then missing 1 or 2 month in the middle....,1
"While I feel this is a worthwhile and educational tool, my 12-year old grandson was not very interested in it so I did not renew the subscription.",3
Something for the kids to read over the summer. Hopefully it will entice them to read more.,3
Very disappointed. My daughter is an avid and advanced reader. The stories in Spider are mediocre at best. We won't be renewing.,2
Daughter isn't interested in them. Very wordy.,1
"Although this is a tourist magazine, it is more appropriate for an Italian tourist...or Italian speaking tourist as it is entirely in Italian.",3
I thought American craft would be a bit more detailed and inspiring.  Not so,3
OK and often good information.  Not the end all I was led to believe,3
Not what I thought it was going to be; It's all salon advirtisements. I thought it was going to be hair styles.,1
I have been reading this for years and enjoy the reviews.,4
too many ads==not enough helpful hints,2
Not exactly what expected. Too many ads not enough articles.,2
Few out there. Euro mags are much better. US better step up.,2
"I got a free copy of the November issue and it states the full one year subscription rate is $19.99, so I don't see how amazon can claim this as a discounted price.",1
not worth it,1
"This magazine is for those that have the money to live on a huge ranch! Also, I have only gotten 3 magazines in 2 years - took 10 months to get the first one!",1
I like the magazine but it took forever to be mailed,3
"I WAS EXPECTING A MAGAZINE ABOUT CRUISING, INSTEAD I FOUND THAT IT WAS ABOUT SERVICES FOR CRUISE COMPANYS WITH LITTLE TO INTEREST THE AVERAGE CRUISER.",3
Good magazine but subscription prices are expensive and it never seem to go on sale.  Aren't they supported by ads like every other magazine?,3
"it is relaxing to read... nothing great, but okay",3
"Interesting articles, but way too expensive a newsletter.",3
"I know it said ""The first issue should arrive in 12-16 weeks,"" but I don't understand why it should take so long.",1
"I feel like every issue says the same things, just worded differently...enjoyable for a few months then seemed repetitive. Will not renew my subscription after it ends.",3
"The winter 2018 issue is the last printed issue .. received a letter from the publisher .. too bad, liked the charts .. rest of the magazine was sparse.",1
I've yet to receive it. Full cry is a great magazine for anyone that hunts tree dogs its has lots of good information,4
to many commercials,3
Interesting magazine need more reviews,3
Low quality reading,1
it's  cool,4
"Very nice coffee table book , not what I was expecting.",2
I prefer the actual magazine,3
"when this subscription runs out, I'm going back to Honda Tuning.  It isa good mag if you own other than Honda.",4
I order this magazine for my husband. He is very into cars. THis magazine is a great magazine to learn more about cars. This magazine is perfect for any one who like cars,4
Font size hard to read. Hard to change.,3
"I just found it too expensive. The quality of the articles is mediocre, and there is a focus on qualitative rather than quantitative articles.",2
"Nice mag, but they dropped all articles about new Mustangs after I just bought a New GT",4
Some issues are full of great projects and some are real stinkers.  Guess opinions vary.,3
"Acoustic issue, which was nice...",4
Not worth this much.,2
Great magazine but only received 2 magazines of a year's subscription,3
Lackluster to the extreme.  Quality articles have been replaced by fluff pieces that read more like a teen magazine than the Time I remember.,3
It's been a month and I don't have the first issue yet so I can't very well review it.,1
Adventures section is actually PAID advertisements camouflaged as good tips. :-( and not reliable.,3
Please  cancel present subscription as it no longer is being read by my granddaughter . She is now too old for this magazine .  Thank you.,1
What can I say. It is Star Magazine.,1
I picked this up on a whim.  I wish I'd put the money into a book or a twelve pack of beer or an over-due parking ticket.,1
The kindle came but no the print arrived--ordered since May,1
I've been an INC subscriber for years and the magazine has lots of valuable info for startup businesses. But it has become too politicized lately.,4
There was not the same amount of content a different sculptures as I had see in past issues. I was a bit disappointed. Maybe the next magazine will be better.,2
"I really don't care for the humor, though I support their right to express their views.",4
Great magazine for socialist. The first two issues I received were 100% focused on bashing Trump and Americans. They will be tossed in the fire from now on.,4
Too many words I can't pronounce.,2
Some interesting stuff from time to time.,4
"Great value, subscription started quickly. Would gladly use this seller again.",4
"It's okay. Light on articles and heavy on advertising. Read my first issue, cover to cover, in about 35 minutes.",3
Good source for surplus gear for military vehicles and restoration services.,4
Retains the flavor of old time hunting with a delivery time of 3 to 4 months for first issue.,4
"It used to be a good magazine but now is too focused on trendy, ugly design rather than pretty.",2
"love this mag,  but it seems to be getting to be more ads then design photos",3
"got one magazine, never the rest of the year",1
"Great merchandise, great transaction",4
"Love McSweeneys, wanted to love The Believer, but it's hopelessly pretentious. It runs an extra block just to be more fussy and complicated.",3
Far too many advertisements and a lot of the info pertains to people with rheumatoid arthritis but I have gotten enough out of it to continue to subscribe.,4
"The information is good, but for almost $300 a year, I don't expect to get screen blinding ads or click bait for ""Hot Women of the '70's, what do they look like now?""",3
I really would really be a lot happier if this would start coming.  I've already bought 2 issues all because the subscription has gone somplace else.  I guess.,3
A good mag for those contemplating rehabing an old boat but deal mainly with over 25 foot boats which are quite pricey for someone on a 17foot sailboat budget.,4
"Resubscribes you without giving you the discounted subscription later, will not work with you, they just want your money, unfair",1
"Textual content has depth and poetic essence. However the e-book version had no graphic imagery
 Making the overall experience too dry for me. Just my opinion",2
Lovely magazine although i was hoping for primitive applique projects.,3
did not realize this was a gay magazine.  not much I could relate to.  canceled it,1
Good information. Covers new RC planes that have just came out. I enjoy it. This is my second year. I will renew again.,4
Price was way too high but everyone else's was too.,2
Nice photos. There are editorial errors,4
stats and player profiles were great,4
Proble trash talk but interesting anyway.,4
I only received 2 of these magazines and then they stopped,1
"The first edition has not been received as of yet...It was ordered more than a month, however I have heard good reviews.",3
"Boring and not as informative as I'd hoped. Cheap print format. I'm sure lots of folks love it, but I cancelled after a few months.",2
bought as a gift - the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it took forever for my mom to get her first subscription and they didn't use the correct mailing address.,1
"Still reading through the book, but it has some nice ideas and is organized rather well.",4
"Tons of ads and multiple covers, hoping you'll buy the magazine twice while in a hurry.
Very little professional content.",2
Not as good as I was expecting.  Complicated recipes and very few recipes.,3
good magazine but took to long to get,3
Small and more advertizing than articles. Don't waste your money.,1
"Nice, short easy to read articles. Not for the professional. For the Psych curious.",3
Good articles to many adds just like all magazines,4
it has diversity .offers online view of galleries that are featured i recommend it for anyone that likes art or wants t keep up on it,4
very intertaining,3
"Beautiful magazine.  Great recipes, however it gets thinner and thinner in each passing year.",4
"Too much advertisement ! Not so much things to read.
I will cancel my subscription. Not enough infor about diet or diabets. Get some regular books about diabet.",3
I like it - but won't get it again.,3
Just the same old fluff.  More advertisements than anything.,2
"Son liked this publication, but it's now too expensive",3
I was supposed to get 6 issues and i only recieved 3.,1
Cancelled my (long time) subscription. Not sure why they feel the need to mix political cuck opinion (Zach Bowman) into a car magazine.,1
I ordered this magazine and only received a few copies.,1
This is now nothing more than a liberal mag.  Might as well be the Ladies Home Journal or the Washington Post.,1
I use to get cosmo all the time but now i feel like its just full of ads...like every time you flip a page you get an ad....,1
Too many ads not enough info.  I used to love their website.  Now it wants you to watch videos.,2
"Waste of money, all adds.",1
"I have received the kindle version, but as of 3/23/14, have not received the print version.  Great issue on Kindle!",1
doesn't read like a magazine but separate stories from a magazine. too different for me to accept.,2
"I like people magazine. However, one of the things I looked forward to each week was the celebrity puzzle in the back. I don't think I'll be renewing my subscription.",4
The new issue was released this past Friday. It is now Monday! Where is the newest issue? This is rather annoying,1
Full of ads.,2
"It is just  gossip, but I confess that  reading celebrity gossip is  a guilty pleasure that  I and many other cannot resist.",4
too many ads!,3
Not very much to get excited about. :(,3
A tad too fancy for me. Some good ideas in high budgets,3
Only evening listings!  Not much info on the shows.  There must be something better!,2
have gotten this for several years,4
"Pretty skimpy magazine. If you want lots of ads, here's your magazine. The articles that are there are decent, just not enough content. May not renew",2
I used to get this years ago. Not as good as before. Smaller format and less content.,3
seems like there is ore ads than recipes and most of the recipes are stuff don't normally have around the house and i not comfortable cooking with since i normally don't use them,2
90% wedding dresses and not much else,2
This was given as a gift but he loves it!,4
The most recent issue of teen vogue is seriously so bad I threw it away. I've got no idea what the people at Teen Vogue are thinking.,1
"Fun when were having spare time, and keep our minds working",4
It's a good magazine but last week I got a notice it is no longer being published and they are replacing it with something I don't want,3
34 pages of ads before you even get to an article,1
"Too many ads, not enough content.  Read online for free instead of paying for print ads.",3
Only three issues in 7 months,1
"The three column layout stinks and it only serves to add fluff. None of the articles are memorable, and they are pretty shallow. They need more substance in the articles.",2
"very informative, happy I am getting it",4
I find this mag to be really boring. I'm not going to renew my subscription.,1
Only received 2 issues.  Magazine content is poor,1
Got first issue months after I ordered them???? Now I receive them randomly?? Will not be renewing subscription...all I can say! ,1
"It won't download, any of the issues, to my phone or my PC so the problem must be with the product.",1
Tried it as a trial. ..not what I remembered,3
"Had to get it for a astronomy assignment, the article was easy to read that I used and to understand. I just wish I could've read it on my kindle PC! I had to use my phone.",1
I cant download more that 28 isssues at one time.  When I try to download the 29th another issue download is deleted from device.  This is the same on both iPad and fire devices.,1
Its o.k. but I like the actual magazine better. It is easier to see the patterns and keep it in hand when doing a project.,4
"I am disappointed that I don't get an issue every week, but it seems I pay every week. And it seems to be less than it used to be when I do receive it.",3
"Needs more out of the ordinary boats,more classic sailboats,and more tips and tricks (like weathering).",3
Thought it was going to be more pattern and project ideas. Instead it is full of too much editorials and stories.,3
"Good content; I like reading about how politics, sports, and taste in clothing, electronics, and cars change over the years and decades. A mini history lesson and time capsule.",4
"Very nice product reviews, but most of the products are luxuries and expensive.  There are more ads than anything else with very few articles.  I was a little disappointed.",2
pretty much what is on the website. there are a few more in depth things. lots of easy recipes.,3
This magazine is for those that are interested in runway and high-end salons...it didn't do much for me.,3
"Very disappointed, will not renew. Not the same magazine I got years ago. Too much about cars regular people could never afford.",2
Really disappointed in the current wonder woman comics. The artwork and writing are not up to par for one of the great superheroes of all time.,2
Nothing wrong with the magazine it's great but it took a month or so longer than it said till I received it. ;(,3
"When I purchased this it said a one year subscription, but it didn't mention that it is only 6 issues. They only send one ever 2 months. Very disappointing.",1
First time.. There are too many advertisements and not enough pictures and content... so far..,2
Read The New Yorker in the past. The articles seem strange and disjointed. Some of the little snippets make no sense at all.,2
So much more advertising than actual articles.  I was hoping with the advertising they would list already existing log homes for sale.,2
The print is too small on the iPad,1
"Reads well on my tablet, pictures are nice. Shorter than I expected in terms of content but that was ok.",3
Haven't received it yet.....I ordered it in December. I hear I won't get it until April or May....kind of a long wait! I am excited to get it....,1
I have had terrible problems with delivery,1
Good magazine but only recieved 4 total.,4
"Like most mags, most stories are actually advertisements for something",3
one of the better bowhunting magazines,4
"A good, though short, summary of the weekly events. For the price it will suffice. If you want in depth information Barrons is better.",4
I subscribe and Takes abot four months to get the first so I get it at the news stand but is nothing good On it!,3
Pretty good magazine but they canceled my subscription 4 months before it was supposed to end.,3
i tried the subscription in kindle....the print was way too small....even when enhanced....the articles were not of the interest that i expected....,2
Excellent publication to improve your philosophical awakening..,4
I just started reading this publication.  It is very interesting.  I like it and I don't usually like these type of writing.,4
informative but I unfortunately don't have the extra time to read it all before it's already old news.,3
Really not much there .Dee,2
"Its not what I thought it would be. I was looking for all things from 50, 60, 70...",3
Not much substance. I wanted to like it.,2
"Old woman didn't care for small print, for lists of hundreds of channels when I watch less than 20, and programs being listed which too often did not match the screened programs.",2
This magazine isn't what it used to be. It's getting skinnier all the time.,3
No product reviews worth mentioning. Just lifestyle stories and travel stories about places most of us can't afford to go,1
The subscription his news stands tuesday and i receive it on friday some Saturday. Not good for me.  It would be good to receive it wednesday at tbursday the latest.,3
Not particularly impressive. I was disappointed.,2
Mostly adds not much reading,3
Wrong magazine. Thought I was ordering Taste Of Home.,1
Great publication. I enjoy reading it each issue.,4
Just reading my first issue...finding it to be an good reintroduction to Catholic point of view.,4
"Short on analysis, very descriptive.  Some of the authors may be a bit thin on credentials or background for upon which they are writing about.",3
This is a fun mag because I often get stumped when searching for things about which to write. I like it very much.,4
"For some reason, unable to access the kindle edition from Australia.
It doesn't appear on the amazon.com.au site.",1
Czytam i polecam - chyba najbardziej wywaony tygodnik w PL,1
"I ordered this a couple weeks before Christmas, and as of yet it is still in limbo waiting for the subscription to start.",1
"This had been a gift, and I do believe that my son had liked it, though he did not ask that I renew it for him",3
not impressed by the publication at all.,1
It took so long and I am RATING IT 0%,3
Still like the publication. Not as practical as use to be.  It is more like Popular Science.,3
"Do note that you will not be able to download this magazine to a computer. This also means that if there are patterns, you cannot print,",1
"The idea of the magazine is great for nail enthusiasts alike, however I ordered the magazine at the start of December and it still has not come (it is now the end of January",1
Not enough content for the price,2
Great magazine for girls. Content is age appropriate.,4
Very upset about this subscription. I got a duplicate magazine. They are always behind in mailing currents ones. Thanks Castilla,1
Clear writing and thoughtful articles - great reading for anyone interested in contemporary Catholic thinking!,4
"Like to look through this magazine for styles and makeup, nice.",4
not that much of iteresting contents.,3
I tried it but Vanity Fair bores me.,1
Never really got the printed ones in the mail.,1
"Too many changes to the magazine recently.  It has lost my favorite sections. I miss the crossword puzzles, word finds, Quiet Moments and Susan Koenig's articles.  ):",3
Always great recipes!,4
"major problems with auto renewal. Did not get Jan-Mar issues. Called repeatedly. Received the April issue today. Hopefully, the problem is now solved.",1
don't like it,1
"The Mag can switch up ? , catch your curiosity ....makes worthwhile.",4
"Always has something interesting, but not as much as some of my other favorites such as O, and Woman's World.",4
"Unless you are an expert in Cal backpacking - I do not suggest buying this bland, thin, memo like paper.",1
articles are not very good,1
"Meh. By the time you get the paper, the news from the web is old. Why bother?",1
gear bag is a joke....do not subscribe for the bag. The rag is top notch though.,1
...mostly advertisements and very few pages.  Not like the old days when there were many recipes to try.,2
way too many advertisements.,2
Only worth reading if other people are hoarding tabloid magazines.,4
It was okay but over priced,3
Hard to change address. Haven't seen an issue yet so apparently still hasn't worked. I will try again and then go back to finding a copy at bike stored every so often.,1
Don't waste your money.,1
I still haven't received a copy of the magazine yet.  Why does it take so long?,1
great magazine. interesting ideas. great price,4
Only for high end users not for the everyday flyer. Way too much on events look who won that type thing.,3
I do not like it because it was purchased as a Christmas gift for our grandson and he has not recieved it and it looks like not until March.,1
"I love this magazine, but the delivery is irregular and unreliable.  I have yet to receive my August issue (as of August 12th).",1
Magazine is great. Have not received the tote.,3
"Magazine is good as always although it appears to have shrunk considerably, however I never received the bag",4
"So many great projects, so little time!",3
damaged package and the product was actually damp,1
Whole family enjoys.,4
Its not as good as it was in 1980s but there are still a lot of fun puzzles.,4
This is a pretty mediocre publication.,1
No bag...no magazine. I am still waiting.,1
great writing; worth the money.,4
"Poorly written. Not supposed to be a politically driven magazine, unfortunate.",1
The tote bag sent was not as shown. It was a tiny bag that can barely fit a copy of AD.,1
Good Magazine. Not A Fan Of An Automatic Renewal.,4
I didn't want to renew and this just came.,2
Renewal wanted twice the price from last year so I cancelled.,1
"I love this magazine! But, it asked me how I rate the renewal. I hate that I have to pay double as a current customer! Why do I have to pay $30  and new subscribers $15?",1
It isn't really what I expected. Please cancel.,1
Not what I expected. Would like to cancel it,2
Way too many ads. I feel like they are just recycling articles from when I was in high school and college.,2
Got a subscription for my girlfriend at the discounted Amazon rate. Had no problems with the subscription. She loves it!,4
"I subscribed for the combo subscription also, but have not ever received any info on the digital version.  I thought it was included.",1
received tote - nice --- but NEVER received any magazines!!!,1
"Too small for the phone and can't view it in my kindle on my pc. For some reason it doesn't sinc and is missing.
Waste of money on my part.",1
"not as much ""fun"" as paper magazine..the keeping of part of items, and rereading at a later date etc... etc...",3
"Magazine is great, haven't received tote bag yet.  10-5-15",3
Takes from January to May for subscription to begin.,3
"Don't always find something I can use, but still enjoy perusing.",4
Came very tattered and water damaged,1
not to bad,4
Lots of ads and content not terribly valuable,3
The online edition is totally unavailable.  I can't get the articles to open fully.  The magazine itself is great.,1
I have been unable to acces the digital access,1
Decent magazine. Variety of content. Advertised clothes are stupidly overpriced though.,3
The first issue was very readable but subsequent issues not so much. Maybe the content was not interesting to me.,3
Not for me. I am not a very DIY guy.,1
A lot of advertisement,3
I like the daily e-mails better than the magazine.,4
"Like all magazines, too many adds, but they have to make money somehow!",4
Not what I expected. Found it boring and lacking information about recipes and articles. I found Internet much better for those categories,2
I never liked any of the recipes posted.  It was a great price though.,4
Not happy.  Almost every page has advertisement.  Lots have all advertisements 3 pages in a row.  What has happened to Family Circle?  Will not be renewing.,1
The Magazine quit publishing as of April 2016.  Now I have to get a refund.  BEWARE,1
I have subscribed to this magazine in the past and loved it. The first issue I received from this subscription was very thin and mostly advertisement. Very disappointing.,1
"Cannot get access on line to review the magazine, even after logging the first time.  Never could get back on.",1
"Nice, but I prefer Verandah and Traditional Home as they are more realistic. Also, the digital version never worked.",3
To much advertising. Not enough recipes.,2
Some of my digital edition is missing in my kindle. I can't seem to get it in my iPad.,2
Minimal Content - The items / products promoted by Oprah are clearly intended for people who have a paycheck of Oprah's bank account or thereabouts.,1
"waste of paper, etc. stick to online content. this magazine's primary purpose is to advertise paints.",1
This was such a good deal at $5/year that I couldn't pass up renewing my subscription. Thank you.,4
"Good magazine, wish I could get it on my surface tablet.",4
Too many commercial ad instead of quality articles so stop subscribing it any more.,1
"I already get this magazine, and want this added to my continued subscription please",1
I did not enjoy this magazine. The articles aren't that informational. Items inside are nice but over priced.,2
More pages of ads than stories!,2
"I am totally unhappy with Good Housekeeping.  Over the years I loved it but maybe because I am older, I don't find anything interesting in it for me.",3
Almost as many pages of ads as articles. I won't purchase it again,2
Too high class for me.  Lots of ads and stuff that just isn't my taste or style.,3
Product downhill from past years,3
Books are behind a month. I bought for son but he has already read at friends because of late delivery,3
"Okay, but not the magazine I remember from years ago.",3
Did not appreciate the automatic subscription.,1
"It was supposed to get my access online and with the app like before, didn't deliver.",1
Digital issues take too long to post,1
Cancelled order. I just like the physical magazine.,1
"so so...70% ad's, font in articles tiny",3
"I ordered for gifts 2 subscriptions.  Only 1 person received all issues, other person received only 1 issue.  Why?",1
Nina Garcia is such a tough critic on Project Runway - thought this would be a better magazine.,1
It used to be more interesting,2
Insightful information but a little too many advertisements,3
not what it used to be.  even the paper is poor quality.,2
Did not come on a regular basis,1
"Too many ads, articles weren't that good.",3
print is way to small to read,3
The recipes look good and seem simple enough. I have only made a few.  I usually get an idea and change it up to my liking to fit into my diet restrictions.,3
Recipes are difficult,3
"Not much content, mostly ads.",2
Too much advertising...too little content.,2
Not as interesting as I thought it would be.,3
Okay deal but it has taken a long time for me to receive my first issue,3
Great magazine but never got my tote either...,3
"I like wired, and I like their strides to cover women in tech, but it still feels almost exclusively like a boys club. I guess as a woman in tech, I'm just not their audience.",3
Not the quality magazine it use to be.,2
Most of the content is for the uber rich.,3
"Wish there was more fashion and articles, less politics.",4
out of date by the time it comes,4
The main problem was the size of the font on most articles is so small it is hard to read. Will not order again,3
took forever to finally get it. Content seems useful but a bit dated,3
a good mag but kind of skinny. wait til it's on sale to buy,3
"Great magazine, great intro price but watch out for the full price renewal $$$!",4
It is not what I was expecting.  Cool covers though.,3
The writing is sub par.  I read about cars everyday on several websites but this magazines offers nothing of interest.,3
I thought I would give Cosmo a try but it just isn't doing it for me.,3
"Good price. It's like Vogue, lots of advertisements.",4
This magazine is a shadow of its former self. It used to be informative and interesting now it's just stories about incompetent hipsters.,2
"Nice read, but it has gotten much smaller. It used to take me a few hours to read this, now it is maybe an hour.",3
Nothing to read really. It took me not even 15 minutes to finish reading the whole magazine.,1
"It is for  younger people, I am 70.",3
I really wanted to love this but the majority of the magazine is just ad after ad. It felt like i was paying to get a book of advertisements rather than beauty articles.,2
"Too many ads.  Not enough content.  Very pricey!!!  Also, it auto renews!!",2
"I paid extra for the digital edition, come to find out, that I can't get the digital on my computer.  It's only for notebooks, etc.",1
This was for my son who builds cabinets. He really enjoys this magazine.,4
Great draft guide!,4
Not very useful for recipes that I could or would use.,2
Even though I cook a lot and have for years these recipes are way out there.,4
"Review limited to two issues. I like it. It has bikes, it can't be bad. I like reading about bikes, the riders and this rag does that. Nuff said for now.",3
Always nice to read. Family friendly( don't have to worry about my young kids being exposed to inappropriate pictures/words). Great articles.,4
"If you love cooking mediocre food with highly-processed ingredients, sure, go ahead.",1
I can't find this magazine on my kindle,1
"I meant to order Southern Lady, not Southern Lady Classic. This has pretty pictures but that is all. I will not renew.",3
Great for muscle car purist. Even day 2 muscle cars. All brands of muscle cars.,4
There are too many ads. Just stick to reading Wired online.,3
Way fewer recipes than I'd hoped. Tons of adds. But not bad.,3
"solid reads, long articles",4
Full of adds. Wish they would give real product reviews.,3
"Doable, appealing recipes. The touristy/home dec stuff is of no interest to me.",2
My wife says this is not her style.,2
This is a great magazine....  Subscribed for many many years.,5
This is a great magazine if I was younger in age!,5
One of the best health magazines out there. I find 85% of their articles very interesting. Better than Men's Fitness.,5

"I love it!  Complete with a shopping list.  Although, I wish it had even more recipes!",5
